<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>SAVED FROM THE SEA.</small></h2>


<p>It has now become so much a matter of custom&mdash;after
that familiar human fashion which causes
us to turn our faces to the rising sun&mdash;to praise
and laud the King, James the Sixth of Scotland and
First of England and Ireland, in the beginning of
whose reign over the three kingdoms&mdash;to which he
has been pleased to give the name of Great Britain&mdash;this
chronicle is written, that there would appear
to be some danger of a wonderful truth being forgotten.</p>

<p>For there can be no doubt that his Highness
follows upon a most remarkable age&mdash;an age which
must be known throughout all time to come as the
Age of Great Women.</p>

<p>And when I think upon Elizabeth of England,
who broke the power of Spain, of Mary of Scotland,
whose beauty and whose wickedness were at once
the delight and the despair of her people, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
French queens, whose talents in statecraft have
never been equalled, I make bold to deny that the
period of the rule of his Highness will be in any
respect as glorious as that which immediately preceded
his time, and in which these great women
lived.</p>

<p>Now, whether it was from the influence and inspiration
of these high and mighty exemplars, or
because it was born of the pith and marrow of
decreed circumstance, and so lay at the very heart of
things, that women should then lead the way, and that
men should give themselves up entirely to their service,
I cannot say. Yet I know that there were other women
of less exalted rank than those I have mentioned,
whose powers, although displayed on but a small
stage, were seen to be so superior to those of men
that men willingly obeyed them, and lived and died
for them&mdash;and living or dying were glad indeed.</p>

<p>And the story which I have to tell is the story
of such an one.</p>

<p>It was my lot, for so had Destiny cast out from
her urn the shell on which my name was marked,
that I, Ruari Macdonald, of the Clandonald, of the
family of the Lords of the Isles, both of the Outer and
the Inner Seas, having been unnaturally deprived
of my home and lands in Isla, should have been
saved to become the servant of that extraordinary
woman called, in the tongue of the English, Grace
O’Malley.</p>

<p>It is also not unusual for her to be spoken of
by them as the “Pirate Princess,” and the “Pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Chieftainess of Galway,” and there have been some
who have described her as a “notable traitress,” and a
“nursing mother of rebels.” But to us Celts, and to
me in particular, her name can never be uttered in
our own liquid speech without something of the same
feeling being stirred within us as when we listen
to the sounds of soft music&mdash;so sweet and dear a
name it is.</p>

<p>It is true, perhaps, that its sweetness has rather
grown upon me with advancing years. Be sure, however,
there was a time when her name uplifted my
heart and made strong my arm more than the
clamour of trumpets and all the mad delight of
war. But it seems far off and long ago, a thing of
shadows and not more real than they. And yet I
have only to sit still, and close my eyes for a space,
and, lo, the door of the past swings open, and I stand
once more in the Hall of Memories Unforgotten.</p>

<p>Now that the fingers of time fasten themselves
upon me so that I shake them off but with fainting
and difficulty, and then only to find them presently
the more firmly fixed, I think it well before my days
are done to set forth in such manner as I can what I
know of this great woman.</p>

<p>I say, humbly, in such manner as I can.</p>

<p>For I am well assured of one thing, and it
is this&mdash;that it is far beyond me to give any even
fairly complete picture of her wit and her wisdom, of
her patience and her courage, and of those other
splendid qualities which made her what she was.
And this, I fear, will still more be the case when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
come to tell of the love and the hate and the other
strong stormy passions which entered into her life,
and which so nearly made shipwreck of all her hopes,
and which in some sort not only did change her
whole course but also that of her country.</p>

<p>And, first of all, must I declare how it was that
I, Ruari Macdonald, a Scot of the Western Isles,
came to have my fortunes so much bound up with
those of Grace O’Malley. In the ordinary circumstances
of a man of my birth there would have
fallen out nothing more remarkable than the tale,
perhaps, of some fierce fighting in our Highland or
Island feuds, and that, most probably, would have
circled round our hereditary enemies, the Macleans
of the Rinns of Isla. But thus was it not with me,
albeit it was to these same ancient foes of my
tribe that I owe my knowledge of Grace O’Malley.</p>

<p>Well do I recall the occasion on which I first
heard her voice. In truth I was so situated at
the time that while other recollections may pass
out of my mind, as assuredly many have passed
away, the memory of that never will.</p>

<p>“Do not kill him, do not kill him!” said a shrill
treble, piping clear and high above the hard tones of
men’s voices mingled together, and harsh from the
rough breath of the sea.</p>

<p>“Throw him into the water!” cried one.</p>

<p>“Put him back in the boat!” cried another.</p>

<p>“Best to make an end of him!” said a tall,
dark man, who spoke with an air of authority. And
he made as if to draw his sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! no!” cried the shrill treble. “Do not
kill him. See, he is only a little boy, a child. Give
him to me, father.”</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter from the men, and
the shrill treble, as if encouraged, again cried, “Give
him to me, father.”</p>

<p>“What would you do with him, darling?”</p>

<p>“I know not, father, but spare him. You promised
before we set out from Clew Bay to give
me whatever I might ask of you, if it was in your
power. And now I ask his life. Give him to me,
father.”</p>

<p>There was a silence for a short space, and I
opened my weary, fear-haunted eyes, gazing dazed
and distracted about me. Then I saw a small,
ruddy-cheeked, black-haired maid on the deck of
a ship, while around her and me was grouped a
band of sun-browned, unkempt, and savage-looking
sailors, clad in garments not very different from
those of my own people. In the midst of them
was the man whom the maid addressed as father.
I, the little boy, the child of whom she had spoken,
was lying bound at her feet.</p>

<p>My mind was distraught and overwhelmed with
the terror and horror of what I had already undergone.
Hungry and thirsty, and bruised and sore,
I cared but little what might happen to me,
thinking that death itself could hold no greater
suffering than that I had just passed through. But
the sight of the maid among these men of the sea
awoke my boyish curiosity. As I gazed at her, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
great wave carried the vessel up on its crest, and
had she not put forth her hand and caught me
by the thongs of deer with which I was bound, I
would have rolled like a helpless log into the hissing
waters.</p>

<p>“See,” she said, “he is mine.”</p>

<p>“Then be it so,” her father agreed, after some
hesitation. “And yet, it may not be well. Do you
understand our language?” he asked of me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied. I knew the Irish tongue,
which is almost the same as our own, in which
he addressed me. For there was much traffic
between the Scottish Islands of the West and the
North of Ireland, where many of my own clan had
settled, the “Scots of the Glens” of Ulster. So I
had heard Irish spoken frequently.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I am Ruari Macdonald, the son of Tormod
Macdonald of Isla,” I answered, but with difficulty,
for my mouth was parched and my tongue
swollen.</p>

<p>“I know the breed,” said he, with a smile, “and
the Clandonald are men who may be trusted.
Besides, you are but a boy.”</p>

<p>He stooped down and cut away my bonds. I
tried to stand up, but only fell half swooning upon
the deck.</p>

<p>“Water, water!” cried the shrill treble. “He
is fainting from thirst.” And the voice seemed
to keep my consciousness from ebbing utterly
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the maid in another instant was wetting
my cracked and thickened lips from a silver cup,
and I drank and was refreshed. Next she brought
me food and a little Spanish wine.</p>

<p>“Let him eat and drink,” said she, “so that his
life may be whole within him again.”</p>

<p>Taking me by the hand as soon as I had sufficiently
recovered, and followed by her father, she
led me to the poop of the ship, where there was
a sort of cabin, or “castle,” as it is called.</p>

<p>“Now, Ruari Macdonald of Isla,” said the man,
who was evidently the commander of the vessel,
“tell me how it was that you came to be on
the wide sea, lying bound and nearly dead, in
that small boat we picked up an hour or so
ago?”</p>

<p>“The Macleans,” I gasped, for speech was still
a burden to me. But before long my tongue was
loosened, and I told them all I knew of what had
happened.</p>

<p>“The Macleans,” said I, “of the Rinns of Isla,
who were ever our foes, but with whom we had
been at peace for a long time, suddenly set upon
and surprised my father’s castle by night. I was
awakened by the sounds of clashing swords and
the death shrieks of men and women&mdash;the most
fearsome cries&mdash;so that my blood ran cold and my
heart stood still.”</p>

<p>I stopped and choked as I spoke. The
maid nodded kindly, and put her little hand in
mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Although I had never seen a fight,” continued
I, “I had been told often and often of battles, so
I guessed at once what was going on. I got up
from my couch, and in the darkness called my
mother’s name, but she answered not. I was alone
in the chamber. Terrified, I shrieked and sobbed.
Then the room filled with smoke. The castle was
on fire. Making the best of my way to the door
I was clasped in my mother’s arms. She carried
a lighted torch, but I came upon her so sharply
that it fell out of her hand and was extinguished.</p>

<p>“’We are lost,’ she wailed, pressing me wildly
against her bosom, while I could feel her heart
beating fast and hard against my own.</p>

<p>“’What, is it, mother?’ I asked; but I knew
without any words from her.</p>

<p>“We were standing in a corridor, but the smoke
soon became so dense that we could no longer endure
it. Hardly knowing what she did, I think, she
dragged me along to a window in the room where
I had slept, and opening it, looked out. The yard of
the castle was alive with men holding blazing sticks
of fir, and flames shot up from the burning door of
the central tower in which we stood. I also looked
out, and noticed dark, silent forms lying prone upon
the ground.</p>

<p>“’Fire or sword? What matters it?’ I heard her
whisper to herself. ’Lost, lost, lost! Oh, Ruari, my
son, my son!’ And she kissed me&mdash;the last kisses
she ever gave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>I broke down weeping. The little hand of the
maid caressed and soothed me.</p>

<p>“We had been spied from the yard,” I went on,
after I had had my fill of crying, and a great hoarse
voice rose above the din.</p>

<p>“’Fetch me the woman and the child alive!’ was
what it said.</p>

<p>“’It is Red Angus Maclean,’ said my mother,
hopelessly.</p>

<p>“Then four clansmen plunged through the smoke
and flame, and burst in upon us. Seizing us roughly,
they took us half dead to Red Angus.</p>

<p>“’Do what you will with me,’ said my mother,
falling on her knees before him, ’but shed not the
blood of the lad,’ she implored and prayed of him.
’He has never done you any harm.’</p>

<p>“He scowled at us, and played with the handle of
his dirk.</p>

<p>“’Why should I not slay ye both?’ said he.
’When did ever a Macdonald spare a Maclean, tell
me that?’ He paused, as if in thought. ’But listen,’
he began again. ’Choose you,’ said he, speaking to
my mother, ’for such is my humour, choose you,
your life or the boy’s.’</p>

<p>“’Thank ye,’ said my mother. ’Never did I
think I should live to thank a Maclean. Swear you
will not shed his innocent blood, and I shall die
gladly.’</p>

<p>“’Have ye chosen?’ said he.</p>

<p>“’Will ye swear not to put him to the sword?’</p>

<p>“’Yes,’ said he, and glared at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Ye have chosen,’ said he at length.</p>

<p>“’Yes,’ said my mother; and with her eyes fixed
on me, she fell beneath the stabs of his dirk; but even
as she fell I sprang from the arms of the men who
held me, and leapt like a wild cat of Mull straight for
his throat, but he caught and crushed me in his
grip.</p>

<p>“’Remember your oath!’ cried my mother to him,
and died.</p>

<p>“Seeing that she was dead he laughed a terrible
laugh, so empty of mirth and so full of menace
was it.</p>

<p>“’Ay, I shall keep my oath,’ said he. ’No drop
of his blood shall be shed. But die he too must, and
so shall this accursed brood be destroyed from off the
face of the earth. Bind him so that he cannot
escape,’ he ordered.</p>

<p>“And they bound me with strips of tanned deerskin,
even as you saw when I was found in the drifting
boat. Then he spoke to two of his men, who
carried me down to the beach, and threw me into the
bottom of the boat. Getting themselves into another,
they towed that which I was in some two or three
miles from shore, until, indeed, I could hear the
struggling of the waters made by the tide, called the
’Race of Strangers.’ And then they left me to the
mercy of the sea.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was that?” asked the maid.</p>

<p>“Two days ago,” I replied. “I drifted, drifted
with wave and tide, expecting every moment to be
swallowed up; and part of the time, perhaps, I slept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for I cannot remember everything that took place.
And then you found the boat, and me in it,” I
added simply.</p>

<p>“’Tis a strange story,” said the maid’s father; and
he turned away to see to the working of the ship,
which was straining and plunging heavily in the
swell, and left us two children to ourselves.</p>

<p>I looked at the maid, who had been so tender and
kind.</p>

<p>“Who are ye?” I asked timidly.</p>

<p>“I am Grace O’Malley,” said she proudly, “the
daughter of Owen O’Malley of Erris and of Burrishoole
in Connaught&mdash;he who has just gone from
us.”</p>

<p>And then she told me of herself, of her father,
and of her people, and that the ship was now returning
to Clare Island, which belonged to them.</p>

<p>“See,” said she, pointing through a window in
the stern, “there are the headlands of Achill, only
a few miles from Clare Island,” and I looked out
and saw those black ramparts of rock upon which
the ocean hurls itself in vain.</p>

<p>“Now Clare Island comes into view,” she continued,
and peeping out again I beheld the shoulder
of the hill of Knockmore looming up, while beyond
it lay a mass of islands, and still further away the
mountains on the coast.</p>

<p>“All this,” said the maid with a sweep of her
hand, “and the mainland beyond, is the Land of the
O’Malleys.”</p>

<p>“And is the water also yours?” I asked, attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ing
a boy’s shy pleasantry, for so had she won me
from my grief.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the maid, “the water even more
than the land is ours.” And she looked&mdash;what
she was, though but a little maid&mdash;the daughter
of a king of the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE PRINCESS BEGINS HER REIGN.</small></h2>


<p>Ten years, swift as the flight of wild swans winging
their way southward when the first wind of winter
sweeps behind them, passed over our heads in the
Land of the O’Malleys; nor did they pass without
bringing many changes with them. And yet it so
happened that no very startling or determining event
occurred till at the very close of this period.</p>

<p>The little maid who had saved me from the sea
had grown into a woman, tall of stature and queenly
in carriage&mdash;in a word, a commanding figure, one to
be obeyed, yet also one who had the gifts which made
obedience to her pleasant and easy. Already she had
proved herself in attack by sea or assault on shore a
born leader, brave as the bravest man amongst us all,
but with a mind of larger grasp than any of ours.</p>

<p>Yet were there times when she was as one who
sees visions and feeds on fantasies; and I was ever
afraid for her and us when I saw in her face the
strange light shining through the veil of the flesh
which spoke of the dreaming soul.</p>

<p>But more than anything else, she possessed in perfection
a woman’s power to fascinate and charm. Her
smiles were bright and warm as the sunshine, and she
seemed to know what she should say or do in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that each man should bring to her service of his best.
For this one, the ready jest, the gay retort, the laughing
suggestion, the hinted rebuke; for that, plain praise
or plain blame, as she thought suited the case. She
understood how to manage men. And yet was she at
times a very woman&mdash;petulant, unreasonable, and
capricious. Under the spell of passion she would
storm and rage and scold, and then she was ill to
cross and hard to hold. For the rest, she was the
most fearless creature ever quickened with the
breath of life.</p>

<p>I have heard it asserted that Grace O’Malley was
wholly wanting in gentleness and tenderness, but I
know better. These were no lush days of soft dalliance
in the Ireland in which we lived; the days were
wine-red with the blood of men, and dark with the
blinding tears of widows and orphans. The sword,
and the sword alone, kept what the sword had taken.
And yet was she of a heart all too tender, not infrequently,
for such a time.</p>

<p>Chiefly did she show this gracious side of her
nature in her fond care of her foster-sister, Eva
O’Malley, who had been entrusted when a child, a
year or two after my arrival at Clare Island, to Owen
O’Malley by a sub-chief who governed one of the
islands lying off the coast of Iar-Connaught.</p>

<p>Never was there a greater contrast between two
human beings of the same kin than there was between
those two women: Grace&mdash;dark, tall, splendid,
regal; Eva&mdash;fair, tiny, delicate, timid, and utterly
unlike any of her own people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Clay are we all, fashioned by the Potter on His
wheel according to His mind, and as we are made so
we are. Thus it was that, while I admired, I reverenced
and I obeyed Grace O’Malley&mdash;God, He knows
that I would have died to serve her, and, indeed,
never counted the cost if so be I pleased her&mdash;I
loved, loved, loved this little bit of a woman, who
was as frail as a flower, and more lovely in my sight
than any.</p>

<p>Men were in two minds&mdash;ay, the same man was
often in two minds&mdash;as to whether Grace O’Malley
was beautiful or not; but they were never in any
doubt, for there could be none, of Eva’s loveliness.
Howbeit, I had said nothing of what was in my
thoughts to Eva; that was a secret which I deemed
was mine alone.</p>

<p>For myself, I had grown to man’s estate&mdash;a big
fellow and a strong, who might be depended upon
to look after ship or galley with some regard for
seamanship, and not to turn my back in the day
of battle, unless nothing else were possible.</p>

<p>Owen O’Malley had received me, the outcast of
Isla, into his own family, treating me as a son rather
than as a stranger, and, although I never ceased to be
a Scot, I was proud to be considered one of the Irish
also. Under his tuition I learned all the ways and
customs of his people&mdash;a wild people and a fierce, like
my own. So far as Connaught was concerned, these
ten years were for the most part a time of peace
among its tribes, and thus it was that I came to know
like a native its forests and mountains, its rivers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
lakes, and the chief men of the O’Flahertys and
Burkes and O’Connors, whose territories marched
with those of the O’Malleys on the mainland.</p>

<p>But I learned much more, for Owen O’Malley
taught me how to steer and handle a ship so that
it became a thing of my own&mdash;nay, rather a part of
myself. He also gave me my knowledge of the coasts
of Ireland, and there was scarcely a bay or an inlet or
a haven, especially on the western shores, into which
I had not sailed. And as he proved me and found
me faithful, he himself showed me the Caves of
Silence under the Hill of Sorrow&mdash;strange, gloomy
caverns, partly the work of nature and partly of man,
once the homes of a race long perished, of whom no
other trace now remains. With the exception of
Grace O’Malley, from whom he kept nothing hid, and
himself, no one but I was aware of the entrance to
them and of what lay concealed within.</p>

<p>It had been the habit time out of mind of the
O’Malleys to take toll of all shipping in these waters,
and to make raids from their galleys upon unfriendly
tribes living along the coast. The fishermen who
came over from Devon, and who paid tribute according
to the number of their smacks, went unmolested; but
the merchant trader was ever thought to be a fair
prey. Thus, except in winter, when storms tied up
O’Malley’s ships in the harbours of Clare or Burrishoole,
Owen’s three great galleys were constantly
at sea.</p>

<p>After I had reached manhood it was usual for
Owen himself to be in command of one, Grace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
second, and myself of the third. It was one of these
expeditions which brought about an event that
changed the course of our lives.</p>

<p>We had sailed southward, and were standing out
one night late in spring about three miles from
the northern shores of Kerry, on the watch for any
trader on its way to the port of Limerick. The
coolness of the night still lay on the edge of dawn
under the dying stars, when a fog, dense, dark, and
choking, encompassed us around, so that our three
ships lost sight of each other and soon drifted out
of hail.</p>

<p>Hours passed, and still the fog lay heavy and
close. In the afternoon it lightened and lifted and
disappeared. There were no signs of our companions.
I made my course for a creek at the mouth of the
Shannon, where it had been arranged we were to
meet in case of any mishap. Towards evening the
galley called <i>The Grey Wolf</i>, with Grace O’Malley as
its chief, came bowling up alongside.</p>

<p>Obeying her summons to go over to her ship,
I went on board <i>The Grey Wolf</i>, when we exchanged
greetings, enquiring of each other if we had seen
or heard anything of <i>The Winged Horse</i>, her father’s
vessel. Neither of us knew anything of it, and there
was nothing to be done but to await its arrival. We
were chatting pleasantly, when I saw outlined against
the sunset flaming in the west the bulk of a
merchantman, which we guessed from her build
and rig to be an English ship, probably from Bristol,
coming on under press of sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>On she came in stately fashion, with her sails
bellying out in the fresh breeze, and we could hear
her men singing snatches of sailor glees upon her
decks. We gazed at her, and then we saw a dreadful
and an uncanny thing. Grace O’Malley was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>“Look, look!” she said. “What is that?”</p>

<p>My eyes were fixed on the ship, but I could not
tell what it was that we saw.</p>

<p>“I know not,” I replied. “Perhaps it is some
new device of these English. No; it can hardly be
that. What is it, I wonder?”</p>

<p>We stared and stared at it, but could make
nothing of it.</p>

<p>“It might almost be a phantom ship, Ruari,” she
said. “But we see it too plainly and hear the sailors
too well for that.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I noticed that the men in our galleys
stood about the bulwarks, rubbing their eyes and
shading them with their hands, as if they felt that
here was some portentous thing.</p>

<p>This is what we saw as the English vessel drew
nearly abreast of us.</p>

<p>On the white spread of the mainsail two huge,
gigantic shadows of men seemed to appear, to loom
large, to grow small, to disappear, and then to reappear
again.</p>

<p>A sort of awe fell upon us.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said she; “we may know soon enough,
for I think it is of evil omen for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis nothing,” said I boldly, although I feared
exceedingly; “nothing but a trick played upon us
by the sinking sun and its shadows.”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis something more than that,” said
she.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind fell off somewhat, and now the
canvas of the merchantman slapped against her masts
with dull reports like the sounds of an arquebus shot
off at a distance.</p>

<p>I saw her name in letters of white and gold&mdash;<i>Rosemary</i>,
and as the way she had on carried her
past us, I understood what was the cause of what we
had seen. For as she swayed with the movements of
wind and wave, we beheld two bodies strung up from
the yard of her foremast, swinging to and fro with her
every motion, looking, as they jerked up and down, as
if they were still alive, struggling and gasping in their
last agony.</p>

<p>I glanced at Grace O’Malley, whose face had
grown in an instant white and rigid.</p>

<p>“Do you not see,” said she, after a moment’s
silence, “that the poor wretches are Irish from their
dress? Thus do these English slay and harry us day
by day. Is there never to be an end of this wanton
killing of our people?” Then she became thoughtful,
and added in a tone of sadness, “My heart
misgives me, Ruari; I feel the grip of misfortune
and grief.”</p>

<p>“Make no bridge for trouble to pass over,” said I,
and spoke many words of comfort and confidence, to
all of which she scarcely listened. Respecting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
mood, I left her, and went back to my own ship, <i>The
Cross of Blood</i>.</p>

<p>That night, while I was on watch, I heard the soft
splash of oars, and presently out of the darkness there
came the hail of a sailor from the bow of <i>The Winged
Horse</i>, as she rounded the point and slipped into the
creek where we lay.</p>

<p>Something in the tone of the sailor’s voice, more
perhaps in the slow drooping of the oars, at once
aroused my attention. Without words I knew that
all was not well. Where was the chief? There could
but be one reason why there was no sign of Owen
O’Malley himself. Either he was grievously wounded
or he was dead. Hastily I swung myself into the
boat of my galley, and made for <i>The Winged Horse</i>,
which was now riding at anchor about a bow shot
away.</p>

<p>Tibbot, the best of pilots and steersmen in Ireland,
met me as I clambered up on to the deck.</p>

<p>“Whist!” he entreated, as I was beginning to
open my mouth in eager questionings.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” I asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>“The chief has been badly hurt,” he replied. “He
lies in the poop cabin, bleeding, I fear, to death.”</p>

<p>“What!” I exclaimed; “bleeding to death?”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I interrupted him sharply.</p>

<p>“I must see him at once,” I said, and I made my
way to the poop, where, stretched on a couch of
skins, lay my friend and master. As I bent over him
he opened his eyes, and though the cabin was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
dimly lighted, I thought he smiled. I took his hand
and knelt beside him. My anguish was so keen that
I could not speak.</p>

<p>“Ruari,” said he, and that great full voice of his
had been changed into that of a babe; “is it you
Ruari?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is I,” replied I, finding nothing else to
say, for words failed me.</p>

<p>“Ruari, I am dying,” said he simply, as one who
knew the state in which he was, and feared not. “I
have received the message of death, and soon must
my name be blotted out from among the living.”</p>

<p>As he was speaking there was a rustling in the
waist of the ship, and Grace O’Malley stood beside us.</p>

<p>“Father, father,” she cried, and taking his head
and shoulders on her breast, she crooned over him
and kissed him, murmuring words of passionate
mourning, more like a mother than a daughter.</p>

<p>“Grace,” said he, and his voice was so small that
my breathing, by contrast, seemed loud and obtrusive.
“I am far spent, and the end of all things is come for
me. Listen, then, to my last words.”</p>

<p>And she bent over him till her ear was at his lips.</p>

<p>“In the blinding fog,” continued he, “we drifted
as the ocean currents took us, this way and that,
carrying us we knew not whither&mdash;drifting to our
doom. The galley, before we could make shift to
change her course, scraped against the sides of an
English ship&mdash;we just saw her black hull in the mist,
and then we were on her.”</p>

<p>The weak voice became weaker still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was too big a ship for us, yet there was but
one thing to do. I have ever said that the boldest
thing is the safest thing&mdash;indeed, the only thing. So
I ordered the boarders forward, and bade the rowers
take their weapons and follow on.”</p>

<p>The dimming eyes grew luminous and bright.</p>

<p>“It was a gallant fight,” he said, and his accents
took on a little of their old firmness, “but she was too
strong for us. In the attempt we lost several of our
men, and two were taken prisoners. We were
beaten off. Just as the vessels drove apart, and
the barque was lost in the mist, a stray shot from an
arquebus hit me in the thigh&mdash;and I know I cannot
survive.”</p>

<p>“What was the name of the ship?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“<i>The Rosemary</i>, of Bristol,” he replied. It was
the name of the merchantman we had seen with the
two corpses swinging from the yard of her foremast.
“You will avenge my death, Grace, but not now.
You must return at once to Connaught, and assemble
our people. Tell them that my wish, my command at
the point of death, is that you should succeed me in
the chieftainship.”</p>

<p>There was no sound for a space save only the cry
of the curlews on the shore, calling to their mates
that another day was dawning.</p>

<p>“Ruari,” said the ghost of a voice, “Ruari, I
had hoped that you and Grace&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the cold fingers of death sealed the lips
of the speaker.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley fell forward on the stiffening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
body; and, thinking it best, I left the living and
the dead together. In another hour the three
galleys were beating northward up the coast, and
on the evening of the second day after Owen
O’Malley’s death we anchored in the haven of Clare
Island, where the body was buried with all the
honours and ancient ceremonies paid by the Irish
to their chiefs.</p>

<p>Then came the meeting of the clan to determine
who should succeed Owen O’Malley, for, according
to a law similar to that which prevails among
our Celts of the Islands, the members of each sept
who have reached the age of the warrior, have a
voice in the election of chiefs. As I was not in
reality one of themselves, nor could forget that I
was a Scot&mdash;a Redshank, as the English called me,
albeit I could ruffle it on occasion with the best
Englishman that ever stepped&mdash;I took no part in
the council, nor spoke my mind until the older
men had said their say.</p>

<p>It was at once a beautiful sight and a memorable,
this great gathering, and the most beautiful and
memorable thing of all was that men were content,
and more than content, that a woman should, for
the first time in their history, be called their chief.</p>

<p>When it was my turn to speak, I related what
I had heard fall from Owen O’Malley as he was
dying, and, without further words, dropping on my
knee I took the hand of Grace O’Malley, and swore
by the Five Wounds of God to be her servant so
long as it might be her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Then her people, old and young, pressed about
her, calling her their darling and their pride, and
thus she became their leader and chief.</p>

<p>But with the death of Owen O’Malley there was
an end of the times of peace and quietness in
Connaught, whereat, like the hothead I was, I
rejoiced, not seeing the perilous adventures that
lay before us.</p>

<small>THE TITLE-DEED OF THE SWORD.</small></h2>


<p>“Ruari!”</p>

<p>It was the soft note of Eva O’Malley, calling to
me as I came within the gate of Carrickahooley
Castle, whither Grace O’Malley, our mistress, had
come to fulfil her period of mourning for her father.
I had just crossed over from Clare Island on a
small sailing vessel, which now lay in the little
harbour under the west wall.</p>

<p>“Ruari!”</p>

<p>It was ever a sound of gladness to me, that sweet
voice; and looking up to the chambers of the
women, half-way up the front of the great square
tower, I beheld the fair face, framed in its pale-gold
curls, against the darkness of the embrasure of her
window. My heart gave a quick bound of pleasure,
and then I grew hot and cold by turns.</p>

<p>For I loved her, and the fear that is born of
love made my strength turn to weakness when
I gazed upon her. Yet was I resolved to win her,
though in what way I knew not. Neither did I
hope overmuch up to that time that I understood
her, for her manner was a riddle to me.</p>

<p>And here let me set down what were then my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
relations with these two women, or, rather, what was
their attitude to me.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley clearly regarded me as a younger
brother, and never lost a certain air of protection in
her dealings with me. To her I remained always
in some sort “a little boy, a child,” whose life she
had saved&mdash;although I was one of the biggest men
in Ireland.</p>

<p>Eva O’Malley, who was two years younger than
I, had tyrannised over me when I was a lad, and
now that I was a man she mocked at and flouted
me, dubbing me “Giant Greathead”&mdash;I say “Greathead,”
but in our language Greathead and Thickhead
are the same&mdash;and otherwise amusing herself at
my expense. But in her griefs and troubles it
was to me she came, and not to Grace, as might
have seemed more natural.</p>

<p>“Ruari!” she called, and I waved my hand to
her in greeting. As I went into the hall she met
me.</p>

<p>“I was waiting for you,” she said, “for I wished
to speak to you before you saw Grace.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” I asked, and as I noticed the freshness
of the roseleaf face I marvelled at it for the hundredth
time.</p>

<p>“Grace has made an end of her mourning,” she
went on, “and her purpose now is to go to Galway
to see the Lord Deputy, if he be there, as it is
said he is, or, if he be not, then Sir Nicholas Malby,
the Colonel of Connaught.”</p>

<p>I could have shouted for joy, for I was weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of forced inaction while the fine weather was passing
us by, and all the harvest of the sea was waiting
to be gathered in by ready hands like ours.</p>

<p>“Glad am I, in truth, to hear it,” said I heartily.
I was not fond of Galway, but I was anxious to be
again on the waters, and who could tell what might
not happen then? There had been no fighting for
a long time, and the men were lusting for it, hungering
and thirsting for it&mdash;only biding, like dogs
in the leash, for the word. And I was of the same
mind.</p>

<p>“But listen, Ruari,” said Eva. “Is it well that
she should go to Galway? To my thinking there
is a very good reason against it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said I, surprised. “What is it?” As
I have declared already, I had no special liking
for Galway&mdash;and the sea is wide.</p>

<p>“By going to Galway,” said she, “does she not
run the chance of putting herself in the power of
the English? Is it not to thrust one’s head into
the very jaws of the lion? The English never loved
her father, Owen O’Malley, and the merchants of
Galway were never done accusing him of supplying
himself from their ships at his good pleasure without
asking permission from them.”</p>

<p>I smiled, for what she said about the dead chief
was true.</p>

<p>“’Tis not well to smile,” said Eva, frowning.</p>

<p>“There is wisdom in your words,” I replied,
becoming instantly grave at her rebuke. “But why
not say to Grace herself what you have said to me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you mountain of a man,” she said, “to be
so big and to be so&mdash;&mdash;” and she stopped, but I
could fill up the gap for myself.</p>

<p>“What have I said?” demanded I, still more
abashed.</p>

<p>“Think you not that I have already spoken to
her?” she asked. “But she will not hearken.”</p>

<p>“Why should she,” said I, “care for my
opinion?”</p>

<p>“You know she does care,” she said testily. “But
there is more to tell you.”</p>

<p>“More?” I asked.</p>

<p>Her manner now showed the utmost dejection.
Her eyes were downcast, and as I regarded her I
asked myself why it was that one so fair should
have dark, almost black eyelashes&mdash;eyelashes which
gave a strange shadow to her eyes. Her next
words brought me quickly out of this musing.</p>

<p>“The ’<span class="smcap">Wise Man</span>’” said she, “is set against her
going. His words are of darkness and blood, and he
declares that he sees danger for us all in the near
future. I’m afraid&mdash;you know he sees with other
eyes than ours.”</p>

<p>And she said this with such evident terror that
inwardly, but not without some dread, I cursed the
“Wise Man,”&mdash;a certain Teige O’Toole, called “Teige
of the Open Vision” by the people, who counted him
to be a seer and a prophet. He was certainly skilled
in many things, and his knowledge was not as the
knowledge of other men.</p>

<p>As she stood beside me, wistfully, entreatingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and fearfully, I pondered for a brief space and then
I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will go and speak with Teige O’Toole, and
will return anon,” and forthwith went in search of
him.</p>

<p>I found him sitting on a rock, looking out to sea,
murmuring disconsolately to himself. Straightway I
asked him what it was that he had to say against
Grace O’Malley’s intended visit to Galway, but he
would vouchsafe no reply other than the awesome
words which he kept on repeating and repeating&mdash;</p>

<p>“Darkness and blood; then a little light; blood
and darkness, then again light&mdash;but darkness were
better.”</p>

<p>Whereat I shuddered, feeling an inward chill; yet
I begged of him not once, nor twice, to make plain
his meaning to me. He would not answer, so that I
lost patience with him, and had he not been an aged
man and an uncanny I would have shaken the explanation
of his mysterious words out of his lips, and,
as it was, was near doing so.</p>

<p>Rising quickly from the stone whereon he had
been sitting, he moved away with incredible swiftness
as if he had read my thoughts, leaving me
staring blankly after him.</p>

<p>What was it he had said?</p>

<p>“Darkness and blood; and then a little light!”</p>

<p>Well, darkness and blood were no strangers to
me.</p>

<p>“Blood and darkness; then again light&mdash;but
darkness were better!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>I could make no manner of sense of it at all;
but I saw the meaning of it plainly enough in the
years that followed.</p>

<p>I felt a gentle touch upon my arm, and Eva
was by my side.</p>

<p>“Grace wishes you to go to her at once,”
she said. “O Ruari, Ruari, dissuade her from
going.”</p>

<p>“I will do what I can,” I replied; but I knew
beforehand that if Grace O’Malley had settled what
she was to do, nothing I could urge was likely to
change her purpose.</p>

<p>Slowly I went into her presence.</p>

<p>“Eva has told you,” she said, “that we set out at
once for Galway.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “but I pray you to consider the
matter well.”</p>

<p>“I have considered it well,” she replied; “but
say on.”</p>

<p>“Is it a necessity,” I asked, “that you should go
to Galway? Are there not many more places in
Ireland for us to go to? Is not the north open
to us, and the west, with plenty of Spanish
merchantmen and English trading on the broad
waters?”</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said she, smiling at my
eloquence.</p>

<p>“Here,” said I, emboldened to proceed, “here you
are among your own people, on your own land, and no
one will seek to molest us. But in Galway&mdash;everything
is different.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is it,” she said earnestly. “That is the
very reason&mdash;everything is different there.”</p>

<p>She stopped as if in thought.</p>

<p>“Listen, Ruari! My mind,” said she, “is made
up to go to Galway to talk over our affairs with
the English governor.”</p>

<p>So this was the reason.</p>

<p>“You say I am safe here,” she continued, “but
am I? Word was brought me only yesterday by a
trusty messenger from Richard Burke, the MacWilliam,
that my father’s old-time enemy, Murrough
O’Flaherty, is whispering in the ear of Sir Nicholas
Malby, the Colonel of Connaught&mdash;perhaps into the
ear of the Lord Deputy himself, for I hear
he is expected about this time in the city&mdash;that
my father was an enemy of the Queen, Elizabeth,
and that I, his daughter, am sure to follow in his
steps.”</p>

<p>“Murrough O’Flaherty!” cried I, “is he not
content with his own wide lands of Aughnanure?”</p>

<p>“Content,” said she. “Such a man is never content!
Then this insidious whisperer goes on to hint
that I am only a young woman, and that my father
has left no heir. It is plain enough, is it not, what he
means?”</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas Malby,” said I, “is reputed to be a
just man and a good soldier.”</p>

<p>“A just man&mdash;perhaps, who knows! That is why
I am going to Galway. I must make clear my right
and title to my father’s possessions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right and title,” I exclaimed, and unconsciously
I placed my hand on the hilt of my sword.</p>

<p>She saw and interpreted the action.</p>

<p>“Our title-deed,” said she, “has been that of the
sword&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so shall it always be,” I broke in.</p>

<p>“In one sense, yes,” she assented; “but we live in
times of change, and things are not as they were. All
the chiefs and lords of Ireland are now getting a title
for their lands from the queen. Even my father did
something of the sort. If I go not to Galway to put
forward my claims it will be said that I am disloyal
and a traitress.”</p>

<p>“So,” I said, “it may be an evil to go, but it is
a worse thing to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered; “but I have other reasons.
It is not that I put so much trust in a piece of
parchment, signed and sealed, although I see no
harm in getting it. Ruari, I have purposes that
reach far beyond Galway, and Connaught even, and
for the present I deem it not well openly to incur the
enmity of the English.”</p>

<p>This speech was beyond me, so I held my peace
until I remembered what the “Wise Man” had said;
but when I mentioned it she replied that she knew
of the matter, and though it troubled her, it would
make no difference to her plans.</p>

<p>Then she fell to brooding and thinking, as was her
way, whereupon I left her to get the ships ready for
sea even as she wished.</p>

<p>So, before another day was passed, the three great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
galleys drew away from the shelter of Clare Island,
and, speeding before a fair wind, made for the south.
Grace and Eva O’Malley were on <i>The Grey Wolf</i>,
Tibbot, the pilot, was in command of his dead
master’s ship, <i>The Winged Horse</i>, while I was on
my own vessel, <i>The Cross of Blood</i>.</p>

<p>We took a great company with us of nearly one
hundred and fifty men, including a band of arquebusiers,
besides bards and pipers, and a priest on each
ship. The priests were not much to my liking on
shipboard, but Grace would have them. Both Grace
and Eva brought of the finest of their garments, all
made of rich Spanish stuffs, so that they might
appear before the Governor as befitted their rank.
I myself took with me two full suits, also of Spanish
make, and such as were worn at courts, that I might
not appear unworthy of my mistress.</p>

<p>As the wind was steady, the black cliffs of
Achill, with the mass of Cushcamcarragh and the
dome of Nephin behind them, soon grew distant
in our wake. The glowing cone of the Holy Hill
of St. Patrick, a wonder of light and shade as
beam of sun or shadow of cloud fell upon it, sank
behind us.</p>

<p>And on we went through a sea of silence, whereon
we saw never another ship; on past the grey or green
islands off the coast, until the wind dropped at
sunset. Then the rowers bent their backs and
knotted their muscles over the oars, and so drove the
galleys up the long, narrow arm that is called the
Bay of Killery, until we found anchorage under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
mighty shoulders of that king of mountains, the
lonely Muilrea.</p>

<p>At early morn, before the sun was up, albeit a far-off
tender flush had sprung up, like something magical,
upon the western rim of the world, the dirl, dirl, dirl,
and the clamp, clamp, clamp, of the oars, as they
smote the groaning pivots on which they swung, was
heard, and the galleys went foaming out from the
bay, the spray rising like a fine dust of gems from
under the forefeet of the ships. Then we caught a
breeze, and the sails swelled and drew, while the
sailors gat them to their places with shouts and
laughter.</p>

<p>Is there any coast in the four quarters of the
globe where you will find more splendid havens than
in the portion of Ireland lying between the Bay of
Killery and the Bay of Galway? Well has that land
been named Connemara&mdash;that is, the “Bays of the
Ocean.” The rugged cliffs, whereon the weather and
the wave have combined to throw all manner of
cunning colours far beyond power of painter to copy,
still less devise, are everywhere broken by inlets, in
many of which all the fleets of Spain and of England
together might have ridden safely&mdash;hardly one of
these bays but has its island breakwater in front of
it for its protection from the storm and tempest.</p>

<p>’Tis a rare home for seamen!</p>

<p>As the day wore on we fell in with a Scottish ship
hailing from Wigtonshire, called <i>The Lass of Carrick</i>,
going to Galway like ourselves. But Grace O’Malley
had given command that until her business was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
finished with the Governor, we were to continue
peacefully on our course, so we left her without
scathe, whereat our men were in no way offended,
there being but little profit to be got out of a ship
coming from Scotland.</p>

<p>A vessel going back from Galway to Scotland
was another thing, for she generally carried a cargo
of wines of divers sorts, to say nothing of silks and
other valuable materials. Therefore made I a note
in my mind to watch <i>The Lass of Carrick</i> when we
were come to Galway, and to observe what she took
away in that broad, ill-built hulk of hers when she
left the port.</p>

<p>That night the galleys put in to the Bay of
Caslah, the most eastern harbour on that coast, and
the following day, without adventure of any sort&mdash;so
calm a beginning might well have told me what
storms there would be before the end&mdash;we made
Galway.</p>

<p>As had been arranged between us, <i>The Cross of
Blood</i>, my ship, let go her anchor in the harbour
between the mole and the bridge by which the
city is entered on that side, while the other galleys
stood out some distance in the bay. Sending a
messenger ashore, I made known the errand upon
which we were come, and, after waiting a long time,
received answer that the Lord Deputy was not yet
come to Galway, but that Sir Nicholas Malby would
see Grace O’Malley, and would give a safe-conduct
to her and her guard.</p>

<p>It was now too late for our landing that day, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
we remained where we were all that night. Next
morning the three galleys rode within the harbour
of the city, and not far from us were <i>The Lass of
Carrick</i> and several other vessels, all come for the
wines and the other merchandise of the great and
famous city of Galway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE COLONEL OF CONNAUGHT.</small></h2>


<p>It was about an hour from noon, a hot sun burning
in a blue sky, when Grace O’Malley signified from
<i>The Grey Wolf</i> that she was about to land, and
that it was her desire that I should accompany
her, but that I should go on shore before her, to
make sure that she would not be detained at the
gate. Having made a suitable response to my
mistress, I gave command to the rowers and the
helmsman of <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and the galley
slowly drew up alongside the wall of the harbour,
beside the gate by which an entrance is made into
the “Street of the Key,” as it is called.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the fierce heat which indisposed
to exertion of any sort, but the place was strangely
quiet and still. Two or three soldiers, with steel
morions on their heads and corselets of iron about
their bodies, gazed at us with indolent curiosity from
the towers and parapets that looked across the bay.</p>

<p>At the gate itself were an officer and his guard,
lounging about listlessly enough in the sunshine,
and taking apparently but a little languid interest
in our movements. A few sailors of different
nationalities, among whom the swarthy Spaniards
predominated, and some of the country fisher folkk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
walked about the quay. Not far from us <i>The Lass
of Carrick</i> was discharging her cargo; below us a
fishing smack, with its one great sail set, was being
rowed out to sea.</p>

<p>As my galley approached within a few feet of
the quay, I heard a whistle, or what seemed a
whistle. Indeed, so swift and shrill did the sound
bite into the air, that it was as if someone standing
close beside me were trying in this fashion, very
peremptorily, to excite my attention. At the same
time, or, mayhap, a little sooner or a little later&mdash;the
whole thing, it appeared to me, came together
on the instant, as it were&mdash;I felt the rush and the
wind made by an arrow or a bolt as it flew past
my face. Then the crick-crack of the barb, as it
smashed and splintered the wood of the bulwark
behind me, followed immediately afterwards. Involuntarily,
I put up my hand to my cheek.</p>

<p>Death had passed close to me, had almost struck
me. Yet, hardly realising what had happened, I
stood rooted to the spot. A queer, quaking sob
burst from me&mdash;the surprise was so sudden, so
complete.</p>

<p>My first thought was that the arrow had been
intended for me, but I had escaped it by the breadth
of a hair, and no more. I was untouched. Momentarily
I expected other arrows; but none came. I
asked myself what was the meaning of the solitary
arrow. At first sight it appeared as if we were about
to be dealt with treacherously&mdash;that we were being
beguiled to our destruction. Evidently, that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
mind of my men in the matter, for they had made
a quick and terrible outcry that we were betrayed
when they marked the flight of the quivering shaft.</p>

<p>Holding up my hand for silence, but bidding them
take their weapons as quietly and calmly as they
could, I waited for what might next befall. Ordering
the oarsmen to cease rowing, the galley lay motionless
on the water. Looking anxiously up at the parapet,
and then at the gate, I could perceive no unusual
commotion among the soldiers, nor could I see a
bowman amongst them. It appeared doubtful if
they had observed that anything out of the ordinary
had taken place, and, certainly, they acted as if they
had not. It plainly was no affair of theirs&mdash;that was
sure, for they were not more on the alert than
before.</p>

<p>Whence, then, had come the arrow, and for what
purpose, if not one of death?</p>

<p>My second thought showed me clearly that, had
the mysterious archer intended to kill me, there
would have been nothing easier, for, standing as I
did on the poop, I was the best mark in the world;
nor would he have required any marvellous expertness
in his art to have made an end of me. So,
as everything about us now seemed favourable and
fair for us, I next turned my regard to the arrow
itself, which was fast in one of the beams of the
galley.</p>

<p>Now for the first time I noticed that it had
been shot into the ship in such a way that it was
nearly or altogether hidden by the shape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
vessel from being seen by those on shore; and I
bethought me that it must have been sped without
hostile intent, but, on the contrary, conveyed some
message of warning which it would be well not to
neglect. Wrenching forth the missile with an effort
from the beam, I examined it carefully, and found,
as I had begun to anticipate, a message; for roughly
inscribed upon it was the word “Beware!”</p>

<p>With the dark, foreboding saying of the Wise
Man still ringing in my ears, it was not likely that
I should overlook any measure of precaution that
was in my power, but the safe-conduct of the
Governor of Connaught had given me a feeling of
security&mdash;which was, perhaps, not justified. Thus
it was that I could not but suspect that the message
of the arrow was meant to prevent me from putting
trust overmuch in Sir Nicholas&mdash;a man whom I had
not yet seen.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of taking with me only six
spearmen, as I had purposed, as part of Grace
O’Malley’s bodyguard, I doubled the number. Besides
these there also landed three gentlemen of her household,
chiefs from the islands, men of proved courage,
to whom the use of the sword was as much a part of
themselves as the breath they drew. I had already
sent ashore early in the morning a trusty steward,
with instructions to procure two horses for my
mistress and Eva O’Malley, and he now, as we made
fast to the quay, came forth from the gate with two
splendid barbs, each attended, as is usual in Ireland,
by its own swift-footed horse-boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>While our landing was proceeding I could not
help wondering who it was that had sped the arrow,
and why he had chosen this way of conveying his
warning. Manifestly he was one who was afraid, and
desired to keep in the background, for reasons that
commended themselves sufficiently to him. Rapidly
thinking over the affair, I came to the conclusion that
our friend could be none other than Richard Burke,
the MacWilliam of whom I have already spoken, and
who, I had some reason to guess, cherished a tenderness
for Grace O’Malley.</p>

<p>And right mightily glad was I to think that one
so strong and brave was in Galway at this time. So
great was his fortitude and tenacity of purpose that
he was quite commonly spoken of as Richard the
Iron, and never in the day of adversity was there a
stouter heart or a more vigorous arm than his.</p>

<p>But why had he taken&mdash;or caused to be taken, as
was most probable&mdash;this extraordinary method of
apprising me of immediate danger, for that and no
less I concluded was the meaning of that one word,
“Beware”? The future was to show, and that soon
enough.</p>

<p>To lay <i>The Grey Wolf</i> alongside of <i>The Cross of
Blood</i> was the work of a few minutes, and soon the
two ladies were mounted upon their horses, but not
before I had told Grace O’Malley of the incident
of the arrow, and asked if she had any further
commands to give.</p>

<p>Now, my mistress was possessed of that high and
proud sort of spirit upon which the hint of danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
acts as fuel to fire or spur to steed. So she did but
cast her eyes over the men I had picked out, and,
selecting a similar number from her own ship, said
that her purpose was unchanged.</p>

<p>“Tell the officer on guard at the gate,” said she,
“that I go to confer with the Governor, Sir Nicholas
Malby, on affairs of state.”</p>

<p>The captain of the gate appeared to be somewhat
dazed with the size of our company, which numbered
more than thirty swords, spears, and battle-axes, and
he arranged his men in a line as we advanced.
Saluting my mistresses with grave punctilio, he
informed us that Sir Nicholas was lodged at the
house of the Mayor of Galway, where for the time
he held his court. But, he said, as he stood resting
the point of his drawn sword upon the ground, orders
had been given to admit into the town only the lady
Grace O’Malley, her women, and not more than a
few of her people.</p>

<p>When I protested against this, he replied that
the Governor was very strict; and as for himself,
he was merely a soldier whose duty was to do
what he was bid.</p>

<p>My mistress, as he spoke, flashed on me a glance
of quick intelligence; then she turned with a brilliant,
compelling smile to the officer.</p>

<p>“Sir,” cried she with animation, looking with her
dark, lovely eyes into the eyes of the Englishman,
“you speak as a soldier should. But here”&mdash;and
she waved her hand round her company&mdash;”are not
more than a few of my people, as it were. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
think that we be too many? Nay, sir, ’tis not so.
Is it not fitting to do as much honour as I can
to the Governor? And the more of us the greater
the honour done him?”</p>

<p>And she smiled again upon the officer, who was
a young man and a gallant, to his undoing. While
they were thus engaged in parleying&mdash;they conversed
for some time, but what further was said I did not
hear&mdash;we had pressed within the gate and filled
up part of the street beyond. Having gained this
position, I had no thought of retreating. The
captain, noting our bearing, and partly won over
by Grace O’Malley’s woman’s wiles, partly making
a virtue of necessity, for we could easily have overpowered
his men, again gravely saluted.</p>

<p>“Be it as you wish, lady,” he said; and so we
passed on up the Street of the Key.</p>

<p>It has been my lot to see of great cities not a few,
but, though I had scant reason to love the place, not
many, I will say, that were finer or more handsomely
built than Galway was in these days. She was now
at the very height of her prosperity, and laid claim
to be second in the kingdom to Dublin alone, and
proudly vaunted her superiority over her ancient
rival Limerick.</p>

<p>As we marched up the Street of the Key, the
ladies magnificently attired in our midst, and presently
entered the High Street, the tall spires of
the church of St. Nicholas of Myra&mdash;the patron saint
of mariners, who hath ever been most favourable
to me&mdash;rose in front of us; while the storehouses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the merchant princes of the city&mdash;the Lynches,
the Martins, the Blakes, the Kirwans, and others
whose names escape me&mdash;encompassed us with vast
buildings of dressed stone on every hand.</p>

<p>On all sides were signs of abundance and wealth.
And small wonder; for there was hardly a port of
France or Spain&mdash;nay, of all Europe&mdash;whither the
ships of Galway did not go. Her traders, ever unsatisfied,
had even sailed out beyond the Spanish
Main to the Indies.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that Galway was
not an Irish city, but an English&mdash;where it was
not Spanish. The strong walls and towers which
belted her in were not more for defence against
an enemy who might attack her from the sea, than
against the Irishry who dwelt beyond her gates.
And keen and bitter as was the hatred between
Englishman and Spaniard, that between the Englishman
of Galway and the Irishman, whose home was
in the country, was keener and more bitter still.
The day was not to close without a proof of this.</p>

<p>On we passed, making a brave show, with the
sun overhead shining on our arms and harness, while
the townsmen stood and gaped, and the women
looked out at us from their windows and doors.
On we passed until we halted before the mansion
of Stephen Lynch, the Mayor, reputed to be the
richest man in Galway. Here, in front of the house,
there was a guard, and I could see through the archway
that the courtyard beyond was full of soldiers.</p>

<p>After an exchange of greetings I was shown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
an anteroom, and thence sent word to Sir Nicholas
that my mistress was without, and waited his
pleasure. After a slight delay, the Governor replied
that he was at meat, and that he would think it an
excellent omen if my mistress, her ladies and gentlemen,
would honour him by their company.</p>

<p>Then, to my surprise, the Major himself appeared,
helped, with much ceremony, Grace and Eva
O’Malley to alight, and invited then myself and
certain of our comrades of rank to enter, at the same
time commanding that our men should be most
courteously entertained.</p>

<p>All this display of friendliness was so different
from what I had expected that I knew not what to
think. Afterwards I learned that Sir Nicholas had been
informed of our numbers, and that this had led him
to change the plan that he had originally formed&mdash;which
I understood was that Grace O’Malley was to
have been at once seized and held as a prisoner until
he had determined what was to be done in her case&mdash;and
this notwithstanding the safe-conduct he had
given.</p>

<p>Separated as I was by some distance at table from
my mistresses, I could not hear the conversation between
them and the Governor, who talked to them in
a certain bluff, soldier-like fashion. Amongst others
present were Sir Murrough O’Flaherty of Aughnanure,
Richard Burke of Mayo, and other of the chiefs of
Connaught who were known to us. But all my
attention was taken up in watching, as carefully as I
could, Sir Nicholas Malby, the Governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no possibility of mistaking him for
anything but what he was&mdash;the successful soldier of
fortune. He had the port of one used to command,
and there was a rough dignity about him that became
him well. His face was scarred and weather-beaten,
and I had heard that he had seen hard
service, both in the Low Countries and in Spain. He
did not come, I had been told, of any noble or considerable
family. His sole possession had been his
sword, and he had rather hewn than carved out
his path in the world with it.</p>

<p>I at once recognised in him a shrewd and capable
man, who would not let many things stand in his
way. Here was one, I knew, to be reckoned with.
Myself a man who both gave, and therefore expected
to receive, heavy blows; he was another of the same
sort, and I felt a certain respect for him.</p>

<p>There was told a curious tale of the way in which
he had become a soldier&mdash;and ’fore God, it is not for
me to say I think the worse of him for it! It is
never a custom of mine to set down anything I hear
to anyone’s despite, yet in this instance the story
helps show the nature of the man.</p>

<p>In his youth, which was mean and poverty-stricken,
he had been arrested, convicted, and condemned
to death for coining&mdash;so ’tis said, and I
understand this to be the truth. In some manner
or other&mdash;I know not how&mdash;he had made interest
with one of the great nobles at the English court, and
was released on condition that he would enter the
nobleman’s service as a soldier, and proceed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
war then being waged against the Emperor. And
this he did, acquitting himself so much to the satisfaction
of his superiors, that he was soon placed in
command of a body of mercenaries, and displayed no
little valour at their head.</p>

<p>Later, he had come over to Ireland under Sir
Henry Sydney, who esteemed him so highly, owing to
the manner in which he had fought against the
O’Neils of Ulster, that, when Sir Henry was Lord
Deputy of Ireland for the first time, he had advanced
him from post to post, until he was now Governor,
or “Colonel of Connaught,” as his title was.</p>

<p>One thing we had heard, and that was, like all the
rest of the English, he was very greedy for money,
and that his ears readily listened to an argument that
was backed up with gold. Therefore had we brought
with us rich presents for the Governor, which were
duly delivered to him when dinner was finished.</p>

<p>Such, then, was Sir Nicholas Malby, upon whom
the fortunes of my mistress so much depended. I
perceived that she was studying him with no less
intentness than myself, but that she hid this under a
gay and sparkling demeanour.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Sir Nicholas said that
he desired to talk with her alone, and they withdrew
together to another room. Whereupon Sir Murrough
O’Flaherty and the other gentlemen of the Irish,
gathered around me, plying me with many questions,
to all of which I returned evasive replies, feeling in
truth exceedingly anxious, and wishing nothing so
much as to be on board my galley again with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mistresses safe in theirs. Nor did I have an opportunity&mdash;as
I desired&mdash;to speak privately to Richard
Burke.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when
Grace O’Malley sent for me and presented me to Sir
Nicholas, telling him that I was her foster-brother, and
that I was pledged to her service. The Governor
scanned me narrowly up and down, then suddenly
put forth his hand and grasped mine with a grip of
steel. I fancied, and herein I was right, as events
subsequently proved, that he had something of the
same feeling in regard to me as that I had experienced
for himself.</p>

<p>“I have but one desire,” said he, when he had
talked for some time, “and that is, the establishment
of the Queen’s peace in Connaught.” And he laid
his hand heavily on my own. I bowed, but answered
not, thinking in my mind that silence was best, for
what had we to do with the Queen’s peace; we, who
were the free rovers of the sea?</p>

<p>Then it appeared that Grace O’Malley had been
asked by the Mayor to be his guest for awhile, and
that she had accepted his invitation. So I now
learned that my mistresses were not to return to the
ships at once, but were to take up their abode in the
mansion of the Lynches along with the Governor.</p>

<p>I was none too well pleased with this arrangement,
remembering the message of the arrow, but dissembled
my fears and suspicions, particularly when
I was informed that no objection was made to her
keeping her guard. I further gathered from her air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that she was not ill-content with the result of her
interview with Sir Nicholas, and that all seemed to
be going as she wished.</p>

<p>Anon the Mayor entered, bringing with him his
daughter Sabina, a dark, handsome woman of twenty
summers, who was to be the hostess of my mistresses,
for her mother was dead. And with her in this fair
seeming entered also the shadow of Destiny&mdash;a
shadow not to be lifted for many a day.</p>

<p>It was never given to me to read the hearts of
women, nor to comprehend their ways, but, being but
a man, I looked upon this woman with pleasure, little
dreaming what evil she was to work upon us. Here
was one, had I but known it, far more to be feared
than the bluff, determined soldier who was Colonel
of Connaught.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE QUEEN’S PEACE.</small></h2>


<p>It was some three hours or so from sunset when
I took leave of my mistresses, both of whom were
in the highest spirits. I saw that my young and
innocent dear was delighted with her surroundings,
and had completely forgotten her objections to
Galway. She and Sabina Lynch had at once become
friends, and, indeed, it was impossible for anyone to
see Eva O’Malley and not immediately to be gained
over by her.</p>

<p>But Grace O’Malley had a certain reserve in her
talking with the Mayor’s daughter&mdash;a reserve that
sprang from instinct or intuition, or a forecasting of
the future, perhaps.</p>

<p>My two ladies had entrusted me with various
orders to their women with regard to sundry boxes
of apparel to be sent to the Lynch mansion, and as
I set off to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, I felt in better
humour with myself and the world. Fortune at
the moment appeared to smile upon us. Sabina
Lynch had told me, just before I bade her good-bye,
that her father was to give a revel with dancing&mdash;after
the fashion which obtained at the Court of
Elizabeth, who was immoderately fond, I have heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of this form of entertainment&mdash;in a few days, in
honour of the Governor.</p>

<p>I could see that my mistresses both looked forward
to it with keen anticipations of pleasure. At
first I could not share in their feelings, thinking
that we did but waste our time in Galway, until
Grace O’Malley had confided to me, in an aside,
that she believed her affairs would soon be settled
with Sir Nicholas.</p>

<p>She had declared to the Governor that it was
her desire to hold her lands from the Queen, on
condition that instead of being bound to supply for
her Highness’s service so many soldiers when called
upon for a hosting, she should maintain her ships
and their crews of sailors and fighting men so that
they would be always ready to do the Queen’s will,
whether it was on the western coasts of Ireland or
of Scotland. He had not said “Nay,” but had put
the matter off until he had considered it more
fully.</p>

<p>As I was walking down the Street of the Key
to the harbour, along with the three gentlemen of
our household who had gone with me to the Mayor’s,
we met a party of half a dozen citizens of the place,
all standing talking together. Their voices were
raised either in anger or debate, and as we approached
I heard enough to understand that they
were discussing the action of the Governor with
regard to my mistress, and that it met with their
strong disapprobation.</p>

<p>“Our ships will never be safe,” cried one, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
came up with them. They made no effort to let
us pass, though the street was narrow at this point,
and seemed rather as if they intended to dispute
the ground with us. The odds were against us,
but not too greatly; so saying, “By your leave,” I
went on.</p>

<p>“Sir,” cried I, the hot, angry blood burning in
my cheeks, as I returned roughly enough the push
I had received from one of those who blocked the
way, “sir, your manners stand in much need of
mending&mdash;or ending.”</p>

<p>And my sword&mdash;a flash of living fire in the
westering sun&mdash;was out in a twinkling.</p>

<p>I knew the fellow who had insulted me. It was
Michael Martin, a rich merchant and a person of
authority in the town, notwithstanding his comparative
youth&mdash;he was not much older than myself&mdash;to
whom I spoke. He had deliberately jostled
against me as I made to pass him, and I was never
blind to a hint of this kind.</p>

<p>His action, coupled with the words I had heard,
had quickly got me out of the happy frame of mind
with which I had quitted the Mayor’s mansion, and
my thoughts were immediately of my mistresses’
danger. His unmannerly act meant more than
hostility to me.</p>

<p>“Draw!” shouted I furiously, and his sword
flashed out at me. Martin was neither a coward
nor a poor swordsman, and my hands were full with
this business in another instant.</p>

<p>“Manners,” quoth he, as our blades rang together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
as steel met steel; “manners! Manners, forsooth!
Who are you to teach a gentleman of Galway
manners? You&mdash;the scum of the sea!”</p>

<p>And so he raved, keeping his eyes warily fixed
on mine the while.</p>

<p>These fresh insults maddened me like the stirring
of venom from the poisonous fangs of a wolf, and
a sudden fierce storm of passionate anger such as
I had never before felt swept over me, as I cried to
him across the darting swords, “We shall see, we
shall see!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile my comrades ranged themselves beside
me with their weapons unsheathed, and several of
those who had been talking with Martin were not
slow to follow their example, but it was rather, as
it happened, with a view to forming a ring round
my opponent and myself, so that we had the fighting
to ourselves.</p>

<p>“A brawl, a brawl!” someone cried, and there
was the sound of the shutting of windows and the
closing of doors.</p>

<p>My position placed me at a disadvantage, for the
sun, now sinking downwards behind the hills on
the other side of the Bay of Galway, cast its rays
in my eyes, and caused me to blink, whether I
would or no, as the points of our swords, forming
glittering circles of flame, whirled this way and that.
I endeavoured to force the fighting so that my
adversary would change his ground, but he was
fully conscious of how much he gained by maintaining
his place, and all my efforts were vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as we thrust and parried, lunged and retired,
my anger passed away, and I found myself become
as cool and collected as if I had been on the deck
of my ship. I had successfully met and defeated
a stubborn attack, at the same time piercing his
breast for a short inch mayhap, so that the blood
spurted forth in a little jet, when Martin, saying
quickly with a choking gasp,</p>

<p>“Another time, Redshank!” suddenly gave way,
much to my surprise, not seeing any reason for his
change of front. Surrounded by his friends, he
turned swiftly, and in hot haste made off down the
street, and, entering a narrow lane not far from the
wall, was lost to view.</p>

<p>For one instant I stood, breathing heavily, sword
still on guard. Then I was about to follow, when
a voice, harsh and commanding, cried: “Halt! Stop!
Halt in the Queen’s name! Halt, halt!”</p>

<p>I knew the voice, although I had heard it for
the first time in my life that very day. It was
Sir Nicholas Malby, the Governor himself, and no
other, who spoke. I also realised that I had gotten
myself into a position of some hazard, to say the
least, with one to whom the preservation of the
Queen’s peace was the principal object of his
ambition.</p>

<p>But the Governor was, above everything&mdash;so I
said to myself&mdash;a soldier, and I flattered myself he
would understand, and even sympathise with, my
feelings in this matter. He was attended but by two
of his officers, yet he came up without hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and the fierce question of his eyes was full of
challenge.</p>

<p>“What is this?” he cried. “I will have no
brawling in the streets!”</p>

<p>I saluted with great deference, remembering,
perhaps rather late in the day, Grace O’Malley’s
orders that we were to do everything we could to
make our stay in Galway a peaceable one, and
made bold to say as respectfully as I could&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, the fault scarcely lies with us;” and I
went on to tell him exactly how the affair had
been brought about, protesting that I could act in
no other way than I had done, as the quarrel
had been forced upon me. As I told my story
he nodded coldly, but not disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“I am resolved to have an end of all strife,”
said he; at length, after thinking deeply for a short
time: “Can you tell me who was the aggressor?”
he asked. “Did you know him?” Then, without
waiting for my answer, he continued threateningly,
“I will hang any man whom I find disturbing
the Queen’s peace, be he prince or kerne, chief or
gallowglass!”</p>

<p>Now, it was no part of my business to hand
over Martin to the mercies of the Governor, and
it was very much my affair, I thought, that I
should settle my quarrel with him personally,
so I made no reply to the question of Sir
Nicholas.</p>

<p>“He was a stranger to you, I presume,” said
he, and was about to pass on, but changing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
mind, he asked whither I was bound and for what
purpose.</p>

<p>When I told him I was on my way to the galleys,
and with what object, he smiled a little grimly,
and walked with me towards the gate. He made
many inquiries as to the number of fighting men
there were aboard of the galleys, and the manner
in which they were armed. I asked Sir Nicholas
whether he would not pay a visit to <i>The Cross of
Blood</i>, but he declined, as it was his custom to
make a survey of the walls at this period of the
day.</p>

<p>“Your mistress,” said he, as he left me at the
gate, “is in good hands.” And I could not but
muse somewhat darkly at this enigmatic sentence.</p>

<p>It was past the middle of the night, when I
was aroused by someone coming softly into my
cabin. A lantern swung from the beam above my
head, and in the half darkness I made out Walter
Burke, my chief officer, and with him Richard
Burke the MacWilliam. In a moment I was wide
awake, knowing that this secret visit of Richard
the Iron was pregnant with something evil. Eagerly
I looked into his face.</p>

<p>“What brings&mdash;&mdash;!” I exclaimed loudly. But
his fingers were placed on my lips.</p>

<p>“Quietly, quietly,” said he. “I do not suppose
that there are any traitors on <i>The Cross of Blood</i>,”
continued he.</p>

<p>“All staunch, staunch,” I interrupted, “everyone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis well,” said he; “but what I am come to
tell you is not a thing to be proclaimed from the
tops of our towers.”</p>

<p>Stirred by a host of thronging fears, I waited,
keenly apprehensive of his next words. They were
heavy enough, although the misgivings I had felt
had not left me altogether unprepared for tidings
of the kind.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley,” said he, in a low tone which
thrilled me through, “is virtually a prisoner in
Galway. The Mayor, or rather, I should say, his
daughter, has made herself answerable to the
Governor for her. While your mistress is apparently
free to come or go as she pleases, she is in
reality deprived of her liberty, as she will discover
if she tries to leave the mansion of the Lynches.”</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“That is what she is,” said Richard Burke.
“She is not bound, nor is she locked up in a room.
Her every movement, however, is watched by Sabina
Lynch. While she may think herself a guest, and
an honoured guest, the hospitality is a mere pretence.”</p>

<p>“But why, why?”</p>

<p>“There are many reasons, as you well know,”
he replied. “The mind of the Governor is set
against allowing any of the ancient customs of the
land; he is endeavouring quietly and skilfully&mdash;for
he is not a blustering bully as some others are&mdash;to
reduce the power of the chiefs and to make
them pay tribute to the Queen. Where he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
show his hand plainly it is always to strike a deadly
blow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I said, impatiently. Grace O’Malley
a prisoner, and I sitting quietly in my ship! The
thing seemed impossible&mdash;yet it was true.</p>

<p>“No need for haste,” said he calmly. “Listen
to what I have to say, and then you will grasp
the matter more surely. Sir Nicholas will offer
no violence if he can gain his point without it.”</p>

<p>“What is his point?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Is there any need to ask?” replied Burke.
“Grace O’Malley is a powerful princess in Connaught.
She has her lands, her galleys, and several
hundred well armed men at her back. Is that not
enough? Are the English not trying to clip all our
wings? But there is far more in the case of your
mistress.”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on!” I said.</p>

<p>“This,” said he. “The mind of Sir Nicholas
has been wrought upon by the merchants of Galway,
who are ever about him, saying this and that,
offering him valuable gifts and such things as he
loves.”</p>

<p>“To what end?”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do, that these proud-stomached
folk have no great liking for us Irish,”
said Burke. “Did you never hear that they have a
statute of the town that ’Neither Mac nor O’
shall strut or swagger’ in the streets of Galway?
There has always been, however, a friendship between
us Burkes of Mayo and one or two of the families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
here, as, for instance, the Lynches, and I hear through
them all that is going on.</p>

<p>“Owen O’Malley plundered the ships of the Galway
merchants, making scant distinction between
them and Spanish or French or Scottish ships.
Grace O’Malley shared in many of her father’s
doings before he died, and the people of Galway
think that she has inherited her father’s nature
and disposition as well as his lands and ships,
and that as long as her galleys roam the sea
there will be no safety for their vessels.”</p>

<p>The words were nearly the same as those Eva
O’Malley had used when she tried to dissuade my
mistress from setting out from Clew Bay.</p>

<p>“What would they have Sir Nicholas do?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Break up her ships; scatter her people; hang,
kill, burn, destroy them; hold her a prisoner; or&mdash;for
there is no advantage to be derived from
our shutting our eyes&mdash;kill her, too, by poison,
perhaps, unless she agrees to the terms of the
Governor.”</p>

<p>Burke now spoke in great excitement, and with
labouring breath; nor could I listen to his words
with any degree of composure.</p>

<p>“She will never agree to the Governor’s terms,”
said I. “She is being deceived, for she believes
that Sir Nicholas is favourable to her suit.”</p>

<p>“Put that hope out of your mind,” replied he.
“Sir Nicholas is merely playing with her&mdash;with what
object you can easily guess. It is for no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
reason than to make her ruin the more complete.”</p>

<p>I assented gloomily.</p>

<p>“Now we know what to expect,” I said. “We
are forewarned and so forearmed.”</p>

<p>“Your mistress pays no heed to warnings,” said
Burke hotly.</p>

<p>I thought of the arrow and its message.</p>

<p>“The arrow!” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “I could not send you word
openly, so I chose that way, getting one of my men,
who is a famous archer, to send the shaft into your
ship.”</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly, remarking, however, that
Grace O’Malley would pay no attention to any
warnings whatever, once she was resolved upon any
particular course.</p>

<p>“She must be told now of her danger,” he said,
“and at once.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, “I can still see her.”</p>

<p>“That I know not,” he replied; “but news of
your fight with Michael Martin is all over the town,
and you will have to walk circumspectly. Sir Nicholas
spoke of his meeting with you, and declared that all
such conflicts must be severely punished. Go not
into Galway&mdash;unless with a strong guard.”</p>

<p>The counsel was wise, but I was quite determined,
if necessary, to disregard it. My mind, however, suddenly
went on another tack, and I spoke out what
my thought was.</p>

<p>“I must see her, and that without delay,” I said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
“but you mentioned that you were friendly with
the Lynches. Could not Grace O’Malley be sent
a message through them? If the Mayor is not
to be trusted, surely Sabina Lynch, his daughter,
cannot sympathise greatly with the dark and terrible
projects of the Governor. Would she not
convey a letter to my mistress?”</p>

<p>Richard Burke looked at me fixedly and searchingly.</p>

<p>“That is doubtful,” said he, at length. Then he
added, “I do not think that we can place our confidence
in Sabina Lynch in anything that concerns
Grace O’Malley.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked simply.</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately, but stopped and
pondered awhile before he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am about to tell you, Ruari, what I never thought
to say to you or any other living soul. But the need is
urgent, and I must speak. The Lynches and myself
are old friends. I have known Sabina Lynch since
she was a child, and I have been made aware in
many ways&mdash;there is no need to go further into
that&mdash;that I am not displeasing to her now she is
a woman. And her father has as much as intimated
that he regards me with eyes of favour.”</p>

<p>I saw it all in a minute. Sabina Lynch loved
Richard Burke, and Richard Burke did not return
her affection. Did Sabina suspect that she had a
rival? Did she regard Grace O’Malley as a rival?
These questions passed through my mind with the
speed of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>“What has Sabina Lynch to do with Grace
O’Malley?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I will not conceal from you,” said Burke, “that
I am not in love with Sabina Lynch, but am in love
with your mistress. Once I imagined that it was
Owen O’Malley’s intention to wed you to his daughter,
but neither you nor she has a passion for the
other. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied. “She is an elder sister to me&mdash;I
am no more than a younger brother to her.”</p>

<p>“I love Grace O’Malley,” said he, “with all my
soul and with all my strength. I mean to ask her
to be my wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I broke in harshly.</p>

<p>“This is no time, surely, to talk of such a
matter,” I cried, “now when she is a prisoner, and
helpless in the hands of people who are her bitter
enemies. Rather let us cast about for some means
of delivering her.”</p>

<p>“I ask nothing better,” said Burke, “than to
assist you&mdash;only remember it is not well to place
any confidence in Sabina Lynch.”</p>

<p>Then we spent the next hour discussing plans,
and having formed one which had some promise
of success, Burke left the galley as secretly as he
came&mdash;his boat disappearing into the darkness of the
night.</p>

<p>After he had gone, I tried in vain to sleep, and
finding my thoughts but dismal company, had myself
rowed over to <i>The Winged Horse</i>, where I saw
Tibbot, the pilot, whom I informed of the visit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Richard Burke, and of what we had concerted to
do for the deliverance of Grace O’Malley. And as
we could not foresee what the next step of the
Governor might be, it was agreed that Tibbot’s
galley should be kept ready for instant action, and
to provide against any surprise by keeping her out
in the bay, at such a distance that she should be
out of the range of the calivers and bombards
mounted on the walls of Galway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>GRACE O’MALLEY DANCES OUT OF GALWAY.</small></h2>


<p>As early in the morning as was possible, without
causing remark or exciting suspicion, I went into
the town, taking with me several of my own men.
The same officer who had been in charge of the guard
the previous day was at the gate, and I advanced
towards him boldly, as if I had no notion in the
world that there could be anything amiss, nor, so far
as he was concerned, was there.</p>

<p>For he gravely returned my salutation, merely
giving me “Good-day” without waste of words, and
waved his hand in the direction of the church of
St. Nicholas of Myra.</p>

<p>When I had arrived at the mansion of the Mayor,
I could see no difference in the manner of the reception
I was accorded, except such as there would be
owing to my mistress not being present on this
occasion.</p>

<p>I sent in my name, with a request that Grace
O’Malley might be informed of my arrival, and after
a short time&mdash;short as far as the actual minutes,
but it appeared an age to me, so impatient and
anxious was I&mdash;I was conducted into a spacious room,
where I found my two ladies, Sabina Lynch, and
several gentlemen, most of whom were Irish. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
were in the midst of a conversation as I entered,
and I quickly gathered that they were talking about
the entertainment the Mayor was to give in honour
of the Governor before many days. They were
speaking of corantos and other dances, in which I
had but small proficiency, and I could not help
saying to myself that Grace O’Malley could have no
suspicion how slippery would be the floor for her
feet!</p>

<p>On endeavouring to get speech with her privately,
I found myself completely baffled, and that so subtly
and craftily that I raged and fumed inwardly. For
when I attempted to draw her aside we were
instantly joined by Sabina Lynch, who smilingly
disguised her purpose of preventing us from talking
together by ourselves under a mock of empty but
pleasant words. Indeed, so skilfully and readily did
she speak, and with so much apparently of goodwill,
that I had constantly to remind myself of all
that Richard Burke had told me only a few hours
before.</p>

<p>What my feelings were may be guessed, but I
did my utmost to conceal them, although not very
successfully, as I afterwards was told by Eva
O’Malley. I never was one who could play the
part of gallant or courtier, and what I knew to be
in the wind did not tend to assist me in the efforts
I now made to be at my ease and to seem confident
that there was not a cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>And it could hardly be that one, who had seen
so much of me as Eva had, but would observe my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
clumsy attempts at gaiety and light-heartedness.
What she thus saw in my manner made her very
uneasy, but at the time she kept her ideas to herself.
It was enough, however, to put her on her guard,
and caused her to watch more narrowly whatever
was going on.</p>

<p>A couple of hours were spent in this way, and,
disturbed beyond measure by reason of my inability
even to breathe a word of warning to my mistress&mdash;I
had resolved to say nothing of their peril to the
woman I loved, fearing lest it might prove too hard a
trial for her, wherein I misjudged her strength most
grievously&mdash;I bade them farewell for that day.</p>

<p>As I left I encountered the Governor, who was
coming up the street. He reined up his horse, and,
after uttering a few courteous words, asked me not
to fail to go through the square of the town cross on
my way to the quay. He said this with so much
curious insistence in his tone that my interest was
roused to the quick.</p>

<p>As a man enters this square from the east side
the first object which meets the eye is not the town
cross, but the town gallows. As soon as I had turned
the corner of the street I perceived that from the
gibbet there swung in the wind, forward and backward
as the breeze rose and fell, the figure of a man.
That the Governor had intended me to see this, and
that it had some special lesson for me, I did not
doubt, so I pressed forward smartly. Yet it was
with an amazed horror that I beheld the dead
man’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>For the victim was none other than Michael
Martin, my antagonist of the previous afternoon.
The Governor had followed the matter up, and had
discovered him whom he had called the aggressor
in the interrupted duel. Verily was the Queen’s
peace being maintained with a vengeance. I had
read the ruthless character of Sir Nicholas aright.
Here, what had been a man, had been tried,
sentenced, and executed in a few hours; and that
Martin had occupied no inconsiderable position in
Galway showed that the Governor was afraid of
none.</p>

<p>If he would not hesitate to act in this fashion
in the case of one of the English of Galway, how
much less would he care for the Irish of Connaught?
This I perceived plainly enough was what he
desired Martin’s death to intimate to me. For myself,
notwithstanding what had passed between
Martin and me, I was hot and indignant that a man
so brave as he should have been put to so foul a
death.</p>

<p>It was in a melancholy mood that I bent my
steps to the quay, albeit I made a great effort to
keep from my face the troubled thoughts of my
mind. Not only had I failed in acquainting Grace
O’Malley with her real position, but I was also well
aware that the hatred with which she inspired the
people of Galway would be made all the fiercer by
the death of Martin.</p>

<p>Striving to cast aside these sombre reflections as
unmanly, and likely only to hamper me in any plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
I might make for the freeing of my mistress, I went
on board <i>The Cross of Blood</i>. I, at least, was free
as yet, and ready to do and dare all. But so far I
could not see my way, and had I been left to myself
to carry out the device Richard Burke and I had
formed, would probably have suffered some such
fate as that of Michael Martin.</p>

<p>The next three days passed without any striking
event. I had seen my mistress once at the Mayor’s
mansion, and the attempts I made to reach her
private ear were met and checked as effectively as
before. I noticed, however, that while she appeared
as gay as ever, there was a something about her that
suggested in one way or another she was now conscious
that she was not at complete liberty.</p>

<p>She had desired&mdash;so I got to know later on&mdash;to
go down to her galley, but obstacles had been
put in her path and objections had been raised.
Then she had grasped the situation in which she
had been placed, but had both the courage and the
wisdom not to let this be evident.</p>

<p>It was the fifth day of our stay in Galway when
<i>The Lass of Carrick</i> cast herself off from her
moorings by the quay, and, towed out by her two
boats into the bay, made ready for sea. I watched
the rich prize slip out of our hands with dismay,
but it was my only business at present to stay where
I was. Yet, as I noticed how deep the Scottish
ship lay in the water, I could not but regret that
my hands were tied.</p>

<p>The captain made some signs to me which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
did not comprehend, but which I interpreted as
ironical farewells. I was the more mystified when,
as I watched her approach <i>The Winged Horse</i>, I
saw a boat put off from her for that galley. But
when the night fell I had every reason to bless
and not curse <i>The Lass of Garrick</i>. For in the dark
Tibbot came on board my ship, bringing a letter from
Grace O’Malley, which she had managed through
one of her women, who had made love to the Scottish
captain, to send thus secretly to me.</p>

<p>Now, the revel which the Mayor was giving for
Sir Nicholas was to take place on the next day,
and in this letter my mistress, who was now
thoroughly awake to her danger and also to the
perfidy of Sabina Lynch, set forth her plan of escape.
It was at once bold and ingenious, and had a fair
prospect of succeeding. That it was not carried out
exactly as had been calculated&mdash;but this is to
anticipate events.</p>

<p>My part was simplicity itself.</p>

<p>My mistress told me to come to the revel, as
I had been invited, as if attending revels had been
my occupation all my life, and to bring with me as
many armed men as I thought could be got safely
into Galway. But on no account was I to omit to
fetch the two pipers&mdash;Phelim of the White Lock
(he had an odd-looking tuft of white hair on his
forehead) and Cormac, his brother. What they had
to do will appear later.</p>

<p>Further, I was commanded to have the galleys
ready to put instantly to sea, for the favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
outcome of the matter depended in the end on the
swiftness of our movements.</p>

<p>Having received this letter, my breast swelled
with joy. The calm was at an end, I said, and now
for the storm; and ever in these days loved I storm
more than calm. My spirits rose immediately as
this week of wearisome waiting drew to an end and
the time of action was at hand.</p>

<p>As soon as the day had come I called my chief
officers together, and bade them be ready to sail
that night, and I gave a similar charge to those of
<i>The Grey Wolf</i>. Then I picked out several of the
older men, and, for a pretext that they might be
admitted into the town the more easily, despatched
them with boxes and bales for our mistresses, which
they were to carry to the mansion of the Lynches.
I also sent a gift to the Governor, in order that he
should have no ghost of a suspicion that I knew how
matters stood.</p>

<p>In this manner, then, I introduced twenty more
of our men into Galway, making up for their absence
from the two galleys by causing Tibbot to send me
some of his.</p>

<p>To those sent into the town I gave as a common
meeting-place at a given hour the tavern that is
under the sign of “The Golden Eagle,” bidding them
thereafter to assemble in the High Street near the
Mayor’s house. There they were to await my coming
with my mistresses, if events should fall out according
to our wish, and then, if there should be any
need, I should tell them what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>At the appointed time I presented myself at the
Lynch mansion. Here I found a considerable company
was gathered together, many of the chiefs
having arrived from the surrounding districts, north
and south and east. In the streets was a great throng
of gallowglasses and kernes, who had come into the
place along with their chieftains.</p>

<p>The scene was one of bustle and movement and
confusion. Among the crowd, engaged in keeping
some sort of rough order, were a few English soldiers,
part of the garrison of Galway. I noticed many
of our own men, and as I passed through them
I succeeded in telling them to take as little part
as possible in any sports or quarrels that might be
going on, but to hold themselves prepared to rally to
me, and to follow when I should call upon them
to do so.</p>

<p>When I entered the large room in which the
revel was to take place, I saw Sir Nicholas and his
officers standing in a group by themselves, receiving
the chiefs and their ladies, as well as the principal
citizens of Galway and their wives, as they came up.</p>

<p>Near them were the Mayor and his daughter, who
was the centre of a number of beautiful maidens and
stalwart young men. The instruments of music were
already sounding forth their sweetest strains, inviting
to the dance; and Sir Nicholas, making a stiff bow
to the radiant Sabina, asked her to join him in a
coranto.</p>

<p>The dance ended, many compliments were paid
to the pair, although to my mind the Governor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
disported himself like a clumsy bear, such as the
Spaniards and the men of the South have to dance
for their amusement.</p>

<p>Sabina Lynch, on the other hand, was, I will
confess, a stately figure, and as she had been taught
the coranto in Spain, where she had been brought up
for some years, and so was vastly proficient in it,
met with great and deserved attention. Indeed, I
heard one of the English officers declare that he had
never seen anyone more graceful or accomplished&mdash;no,
not even at the Court of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>After a brief rest, Sir Nicholas again appeared,
now leading forth Grace O’Malley. Although she
thoroughly understood what a mockery all this
courtesy on the part of the Governor was, she let
no sign of her knowledge escape her. She had
too great a soul for that; but had she not been cast
in this mould of heroes she might, as a woman, have
acted just as she did, so that she should give no
triumph to Sabina Lynch.</p>

<p>Dance followed dance in quick succession, and
both of my mistresses took their full share of all
that went on. Both of them appeared to be devoting
themselves without reserve to the pleasure of the
occasion, and I could not but admire them. My
love for Eva O’Malley was quickened anew, if that
were possible, when I saw how unmoved she was,
and how brave a carriage she kept, despite the fact
that she knew they were but prisoners in the hands
of the English, and in grievous peril of their lives.</p>

<p>I felt I could not have danced with a halter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
round my neck, yet here was this small, delicate
woman doing this, and doing it as if she did not
see the dangers that threatened her. The body,
indeed, was weak, but the heart&mdash;how big it was!</p>

<p>Thank God, I say, for the great hearts of women!</p>

<p>I tried to acquit myself also in the course of
the entertainment to the best of my ability, but for
the most part, being no skilled performer in the
matter of corantos and other dances, was perforce
compelled to spend much of the time leaning against
the wall. Once, as the Governor was passing me
by, he stopped and spoke.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “I have to render you my grateful
acknowledgments for the handsome gift you have
sent me this day.”</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas,” replied I, “the gift was sent you
by command of my mistress.”</p>

<p>The cruel, fierce eyes twinkled, and too late I
perceived that my thoughtless words were making
him suspect that some communication had passed
between Grace O’Malley and myself in spite of his
efforts and those of Sabina Lynch to prevent it.
Thinking to undo the effect of my heedless speech,
I made speed to continue.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said I, “that had my mistress been
on her galley she would not have come to this revel
in your honour with empty hands.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well spoken, by St. George!” said he. “Yet
methinks there be few in Ireland that can afford to
be so generous.”</p>

<p>The Governor’s brow relaxed, then clouded over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
again, for, on reflecting on my speech, he saw there
was that in it which suggested I was not unaware
that my mistress had been debarred from going down
to her ships.</p>

<p>“You must reap rich harvests,” continued he,
after a brief hesitation, “on the coast of Clew Bay,
yet am I informed that nothing grows there but
rocks.”</p>

<p>Howbeit the strains of music, rising and falling
like a summer sea, were borne upon the air, and Sir
Nicholas moved off to his own place. But his
manner made me anxious that what we had planned
might not long be postponed.</p>

<p>The hours one by one went by, and the time
came.</p>

<p>I saw my mistress, laughter in her eyes and on
her lips, approach Sir Nicholas, and enter into a gay
conversation with him. I moved up nearer to the
top of the room.</p>

<p>“If you have never seen it, Sir Nicholas,” I
heard her saying, “sure am I you would like to
see it.”</p>

<p>I listened in painful suspense for the answer of
the Governor. Everything depended on it. “Who
could resist Grace O’Malley, when she chose to be
resistless?” I asked myself. Then I remembered
what I had heard and seen of Sir Nicholas, and I
replied to my beating heart that here was a man
who might resist. But he had no suspicion whatever,
and he fell into the trap, baited so cunningly
by a woman’s wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have seen it,” said he, “and if you will honour
me by dancing it with me&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“The honour, Sir Nicholas,” quoth she, saucily,
“is mine.”</p>

<p>The matter did not fall out quite as we had
hoped, for it had been part of our plan that I was
forthwith to have danced one of our wild Irish
measures, which are more a test of endurance than
an exhibition of grace, with my mistress.</p>

<p>It was soon spread through the assembly that
the Governor and my mistress were to dance the
dance of the country people, and on this proof of
his affability towards us there were loud shouts of
approval. Then there was a cry for the pipers, and,
presently, just as we had schemed, in strode Phelim
of the White Lock, and Cormac, our men&mdash;striding
along the hall, with their pipes blowing the quick
step to a merry and rollicksome tune.</p>

<p>Forward came Sir Nicholas and Grace O’Malley,
while the people stood round about in a wide circle.
But the Governor was no match for my mistress, and
he soon began to hang out signals of distress, whereupon,
greatly to his discomfiture, she wheeled about
and beckoned to Sir Murrough O’Flaherty, of Aughanure,
her bitter enemy, to take his place&mdash;displaying
in this selection her wonderful craft; for how could
anyone suppose&mdash;the Governor certainly least of all&mdash;that
the O’Flaherty was chosen but to throw dust
in his eyes?</p>

<p>My mistress danced with gliding, pit-patting feet
that never tired, while the applause which greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
her every motion grew to a wild enthusiasm. Sir
Murrough O’Flaherty had to acknowledge himself
beaten, and retired. Grace O’Malley now cried aloud
to me to come forward, and I stepped from the crowd,
my heart beating faster than it had ever done in
the day of battle.</p>

<p>“Dance, dance, dance!” cried she to me, and she
whirled about like a mad thing.</p>

<p>“Have ye no pity on the pipers?” I exclaimed,
with a laugh that rang out, it seemed to me, false
and hollow, but I was determined to follow her lead
as best I might.</p>

<p>“The feet were never made,” said she, as she
advanced more slowly towards me and I took up my
position opposite to her, and began the steps, “that
can out-play a piper.”</p>

<p>The company smiled, grimaced, and murmured
with delight at her answer, and the pipers, well
pleased also, played as they never had played before.
And the wild and furious dance went on to the wild
and furious music of the pipes. Meanwhile I was
watching my mistress with hungry, eager eyes,
waiting for her to give the sign.</p>

<p>“Pipe, pipe!” she cried; and again, “Pipe, pipe!”
and the playing of Phelim and Cormac was like
the roaring of the storm among the trees of the
forest.</p>

<p>So the dance went madly on until all the people
about us grew quite still and silent, looking on more
breathlessly than we who were dancing to that mad
music&mdash;looking at such a measure as they never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
witnessed before in all their lives, or ever, I dare
swear, saw the like of again.</p>

<p>Then came the sign.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley’s uplifted hand slowly dropped to
her side as with sheer weariness; the tall, queenly
figure seemed to droop, to sway uncertainly, to totter,
to fall upon the floor, but even as she fell I had
gathered her up in these great arms of mine, and was
carrying her through the press towards the chambers
of the women.</p>

<p>Eva O’Malley flew to my side, her face full of fear,
as it appeared to be. The pipers’ music suddenly
ceased. But no more I saw or heard of what
happened next in the room of the revel.</p>

<p>No sooner had the door of the apartments of the
women closed upon us three, than Grace O’Malley
slipped from my arms and stood up, her faintness&mdash;which
had been merely assumed&mdash;disappearing at
once.</p>

<p>“Quick, quick!” she cried, pointing to a door.
“There is the stair! That is the way!”</p>

<p>They stopped, however, for a little, to get a
couple of heavy cloaks with which they hoped they
might be able to conceal themselves somewhat from
curious eyes. Short as the time was which this took,
it was enough to permit Sabina Lynch to enter the
apartment, and she at once perceived not only that
my mistress had recovered in a marvellous brief
space, but also what our project was.</p>

<p>“Seize her,” said Grace O’Malley, as she and Eva
were leaving the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>I rushed towards the woman, and, clapping my
hand to her mouth, prevented her from giving forth
the scream she was on the point of uttering. As I
was glancing about for something with which I might
gag her, and so effectually silence her, my mistress
again appeared, and said, her eyes blazing with
anger:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bring her with you, if you can; the way is
clear.”</p>

<p>“A gag!” I said, and Grace O’Malley made with
her own hands one, with which she stuffed Sabina
Lynch’s mouth, and next she bound the woman’s arms.
Then I took Sabina Lynch up, and in silence we
descended the stair which led us into the street some
twenty yards from the main entrance into the
Mayor’s house.</p>

<p>It was now dark, but not sufficiently so as to hide
us completely from observation, and an instant’s
thought convinced me that carrying a bound
woman, as I was doing, it was impossible to go very
far without being seen by someone who would instantly
give the alarm. Therefore, still keeping in
the shadow of the house, I sent forth into the night
the O’Malley battle cry, knowing that our men could
not be out of hearing; and the sound had not died
away when there arose a great noise and shouting.</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley! O’Malley!” was heard on all
sides.</p>

<p>“To me, to me&mdash;here!” I cried.</p>

<p>And, in less time than seemed likely, there were
gathered about us nearly all our men, but mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
them several Burkes, O’Flahertys, and others of the
Irish. Recognising their mistress, the O’Malleys set
up a joyful sound. Forming some of them in a line
across the street, I begged Grace O’Malley and Eva to
take with them the rest, and to hasten toward the
gate, and this they accordingly did, while two of our
people carried Sabina Lynch between them in the
same direction.</p>

<p>In the meantime the flight of my mistresses had
been discovered. I saw lights flitting about the courtyard,
and heard the words of command given in the
strident tones of Sir Nicholas, then the tramp, tramp
of the feet of the soldiers smote upon the night air.</p>

<p>To have a conflict in the streets of Galway, just at
the place where the English were strongest, was not
to be thought of, as it was not more foolish than it
was unnecessary, so I ordered my men to retreat as
swiftly as was practicable towards the gate, and to
endeavour to catch up to Grace O’Malley before the
gate was reached by them.</p>

<p>But when we came to the gate we found it had
already been forced by our chieftainess, who had
taken the feeble guard completely unprepared, and so
had quietly made an end of them. It was all the
work of a few seconds; yet in the struggle, short as it
was, Sabina Lynch had effected her escape. Without
delay we proceeded to embark in the galleys, and to
put out to sea.</p>

<p>While we were engaged in this manner the great
bell of the church of St. Nicholas suddenly boomed
sharply through the night: soldiers began to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
on the battlements, torches flared from the walls, and
bullets and arrows poured upon us as the galleys drew
away from the quay. Some of the shots were aimed
so well that two of our people, one of whom was
Walter Burke, were slain and several others wounded.</p>

<p>Then, as we proceeded on our way into the bay,
the sputtering fire ceased.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE DIE CAST.</small></h2>


<p>That night I reflected with joy that the die was cast,
as, after our breaking out of Galway, there could be
no peace between Grace O’Malley and Sir Nicholas&mdash;at
any rate, until the matter was composed in some
definite fashion.</p>

<p>I trod the deck with a feeling of extraordinary
buoyancy, and sniffed the salt air with delight as the
galleys headed for Inishmore, the largest of the three
isles of Arran, which have been thrown for a protection
by the hand of God, almost in a straight line,
across the entrance to the bay of Galway.</p>

<p>All that I cared for in the world was held in these
ships, now speeding over the water under the leadership
of Tibbot the Pilot.</p>

<p>It was with deep satisfaction that I went over
the events of the evening which had brought us with
such success out of the town, and I looked forward
with wide-eyed eagerness to the morning when I
should meet my mistress, and hear her narrative of
all that had passed when she and Eva were prisoners
in the mansion of the Lynches.</p>

<p>Eva, who had kept up so bravely while the danger
was greatest, had become faint and unstrung when
the peril was past. Grace O’Malley would suffer no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
one but herself to tend her, and thus I had had no
opportunity for conversing with either of them after
we had made good our escape.</p>

<p>When we had arrived at the island, and had let
go our anchors in a fair depth of water in a small bay,
which was sheltered from the full shock of the
Atlantic by a range of abrupt craggy headlands, I
went on board <i>The Grey Wolf</i> to see my mistresses,
but Grace O’Malley received me alone, her foster-sister
not having altogether recovered from the
fatigue of the preceding evening. There was a new
hardness, even a harshness, both in the face and
voice of Grace.</p>

<p>At first, however, she was in no mood for recounting
her experiences, and could do nothing but
lament the fact that Sabina Lynch had managed to
get away when the gate was forced. Indeed, her
escape appeared entirely to overshadow in her mind
her own escape and that of Eva.</p>

<p>“Had it not been for her plottings and schemings,”
said she, “I should have brought the Governor
round to my will. I had several interviews with Sir
Nicholas, and at the beginning he was inclined to
grant my suit, but soon I felt I was being thwarted
by one more subtle than Sir Nicholas. How that
woman hates me! I did not suspect her at once,
for I had given her no cause of offence.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out,” asked I, “why she hates
you?”</p>

<p>“’Tis from jealousy,” said she. “Sabina Lynch
would be Queen of Connaught, but she thinks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
as long as I am free and powerful I am her
rival.”</p>

<p>“Is there no other reason?” inquired I, remembering
the words of Richard Burke. “Is there not
between you two a cause more personal?”</p>

<p>“There may be,” she replied thoughtfully; “for
clever as she is, she was not sufficiently so to conceal
from me her predilection for the MacWilliam.
But what is that to me? Richard Burke is
nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“You may be much to him, however,” I answered,
whereat she grew more thoughtful still. Being a
woman, I said to myself, she could hardly have
failed to read the signs of his regard for her. Then
I told her of the midnight visit he had paid me,
saying nothing, nevertheless, of what Richard Burke
had confided to me in regard to his love for
herself.</p>

<p>“He is a friend,” said she, after musing for
awhile, “and I may have need of many such.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what passed between you and Sir
Nicholas.”</p>

<p>She paced the floor of the poop-cabin with quick,
uneven steps; then she stopped and spoke.</p>

<p>“After our first meeting,” said she, “he was much
less open with me, asking me many questions, but
giving no expression of his own views with respect
to the ships. Two things, however, he impressed
upon me. One was that he considered that I should
make immediately a suitable marriage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A suitable marriage!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>“The other was that it was common report that
my father had left great riches behind him, and
that, as he had never paid any tribute to the Queen,
I must now make good his deficiencies in that
respect.”</p>

<p>“Tribute,” said I blankly.</p>

<p>“He proposed to marry me&mdash;for he declared I was
in reality a ward of the Crown, and, therefore, at his
disposal&mdash;to Sir Murrough O’Flaherty, a man old
enough to be my father&mdash;and our enemy. I would
have none of it. I fancy I have to thank Sabina
Lynch for suggesting it to Sir Nicholas, and I replied
to him, with indignation, that I was a free woman,
and would give my hand where I pleased. It was
then that I discovered that I was no longer at liberty,
for it was told me that I must on no account leave
the Lynches’ house without the permission of the
Governor, but that no harm would come to me if I
consented to his terms. I spoke of the safe conduct
which Sir Nicholas had given me, but that was of no
avail; and ’reasons of State,’ said he, overruled any
safe conduct.”</p>

<p>“This is how they keep faith!” I cried, bitterly.</p>

<p>“It was no time for railing,” continued Grace
O’Malley, “as I was in the Governor’s hands, and
could see no way of getting out of them. Therefore
I made as though I were about to submit myself,
and I desired to see the Governor again with respect
to the tribute to be paid to the Queen. My request
being granted, Sir Nicholas acquainted me with his
determination, demanding a thousand cows and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
hundred mares, or their equivalent in gold and silver,
by way of payment of the arrears, and two hundred
cows each year for the future.”</p>

<p>“To all of which you said No!” cried I.</p>

<p>“Nay, Ruari,” replied she, “I had to match my
wits against his power over me&mdash;was not I his
prisoner?&mdash;and so I returned him no immediate
answer, but, on the contrary, besought that I might
have a week to deliberate in, bemoaning my hard
fate, and protesting that I should never be able to
comply with his demands, yet that I would do
what was within my ability to compass.”</p>

<p>“And then?” I said.</p>

<p>“He pondered long and deeply, hesitating and
doubtful; so, knowing the covetous nature of the
man,” said she, “I took the cross I was wearing
from my neck, and, giving it to him, begged that
he would grant me the delay I sought.”</p>

<p>“Your jewelled cross?” I said.</p>

<p>“My case was an evil one,” replied she, “and I
did it not without pain, for the cross had been my
mother’s, and was, besides, of great value.”</p>

<p>“He consented?”</p>

<p>“He became very gracious because of the bribe,”
replied she, “and then asked me to be present at
the revel. ’Why,’ said he, ’should you not take
part in it, if you would care so to do?’ As I was
resolved to humour him, I was complaisant, and
replied that nothing would be more agreeable to
me; but even as I uttered these words, some inkling
of the plan for our deliverance which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
carried out was forming itself in my mind. My
woman afterwards managed to leave the Lynches’
unobserved with the letter I wrote you, and gave
it to the captain of the Scottish ship we passed on
our way to Galway. My only fear was that he
might inform the Governor, and so our plans
would have been frustrated; but he has proved
himself a true man, and one who may be trusted.”</p>

<p>“There is no confidence to be put in Sir
Nicholas,” said I.</p>

<p>“The man is hard, stark, relentless,” said she,
hotly, “but he shall find I am as hard, stark, and
relentless as he is himself. Vengeance&mdash;vengeance,
and that speedy, will I take!”</p>

<p>Never had I seen Grace O’Malley so carried
away by passion as now. Her eyes were blazing
fires; the line made by her lips was like the edge
of a sword, so clear and sharp it was; the cheeks
lost their colour and roundness, and, as she restlessly
moved about, her black hair flew round her
head like a coronal of quivering water-snakes.</p>

<p>“Vengeance&mdash;vengeance!” she cried.</p>

<p>Her vehemence bore me along as upon a fast-flowing
tide.</p>

<p>“Vengeance&mdash;vengeance!” I shouted, so that
my voice rang out far beyond the galley.</p>

<p>“It is in our own hands,” she said, more composedly.
“The wine fleet from Spain is expected
in Galway to-day or to-morrow&mdash;at any moment
we may see their sails on the southern edge of the
sea. Then, then,” cried she furiously, her anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
rising again like the sudden, fierce blast of the
tempest, “shall I teach Galway and Sir Nicholas
to fear and dread my name.”</p>

<p>The wine fleet! This was a quarry, indeed!</p>

<p>For each year at this season there set out from
Cadiz for Limerick and Galway a goodly fleet of
galleons, each of which carried a burden more to be
desired than a king’s ransom. These ships were
laden with many barrels of the wines both of
France and Spain, with rolls of silks, with bales
of fine leather, with suits of raiment and shirts
of mail, and blades of Toledo, and with other
articles of price, the products of Europe, and, even,
to some extent, of the mysterious Orient, where
Turk and infidel held their sway. These were exchanged
against the fish&mdash;for which our island was
famous&mdash;the hides, salt, meat, wheat, and barley of
the country.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley’s vengeance on Galway was to
attack, capture, or destroy that portion of the wine
fleet, as it was commonly spoken of, the destination
of which was that town. The boldness and daring
of the project took my breath away; but I could
conceive of nothing that was so likely to cause
consternation and terror as its successful issue to
the great merchants of the city, and to mortify
and enrage the Governor.</p>

<p>It was a great enterprise&mdash;this attack&mdash;and one
which, if the event went against us, would probably
be the end of us all. But there was one thing
that gave us an advantage, which, skilfully used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
could not fail to be of such importance as to be
almost in itself decisive. This was that the wine
fleet had arrived safely at Galway year after year,
without falling in with any danger other than that
which came from the ordinary risks of the sea.
Hence the immunity they had so long enjoyed
would breed in them a feeling of complete security,
and dispose them to be careless of precautions.</p>

<p>Still I was staggered; and what was passing
through my mind being seen in my face, Grace
O’Malley inquired, a trifle disdainfully:</p>

<p>“Think ye, Ruari, the venture too much for
me?”&mdash;and the accent fell on the last word of the
sentence. “I tell you, Nay!”</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;nothing,” exclaimed I, wildly, “is too
high for you! As for me, it is yours to command&mdash;mine
to obey.”</p>

<p>Then we took counsel together, first having
summoned Tibbot the Pilot, and the other chiefs
and officers who were in the galleys. When Grace
O’Malley had made her purpose known there was
at first the silence of stupefaction, then there followed
the rapid, incoherent, impulsive exclamations
of fierce and savage glee.</p>

<p>While we were occupied in this manner, a
fishing smack had come into the bay, and on it
were the pipers Phelim and Cormac and some
others of our men, whom we had been forced to
leave behind, but who had made their way out of
Galway, being secretly helped therein by the fisher-folk
who dwelt in a village by themselves without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the gates. These brought word that the city was
in a state of great alarm, and that the Governor
had declared that he would not rest until he had
sent out an expedition to raze Grace O’Malley’s
castles to the ground, to destroy her galleys, and
to blot out her name from Ireland.</p>

<p>Nothing had been needed to add to our determination,
but, if need there had been, here it was.
We were now all proclaimed rebels and traitors,
so that we could look for nothing but torture and
death at the hands of the English. A price would
soon be placed upon our heads, and whoever
wrought us a mischief or an injury of any kind
would be considered as doing the Queen a service.</p>

<p>Such was our situation. To most of our people
the Queen of England was no more than an empty
name, and even to those of us who appreciated the
might and resources of that princess, it appeared
better that we should be aware of who were our
foes and who were our friends, and if her representative,
Sir Nicholas Malby, were our open
enemy, as we were now well assured he was, we
knew with whom our quarrel lay, and what we
might expect from him.</p>

<p>When all was said, the Governor had no overwhelming
force at his disposal, and he was without
ships, so that we felt no whit downcast with our
lot; contrariwise, there was such gladness amongst
us at the promise of the fighting with which our circumstances
were pregnant that the hearts of any who
doubted were uplifted and made firm and steadfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>As we were discussing our affairs Eva O’Malley
entered the cabin. As our eyes met she smiled
upon me, and held out her hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“’Twas well done,” said she, referring to our
escape from Galway, her thoughts still dwelling on
the adventures of the past night. But when she
heard of what we had been speaking, and of the
proposed attack on the wine fleet, her sweet face
became pale and troubled.</p>

<p>“Darkness and blood,” said she, turning to me.
“Oh! Ruari, the words of the Wise Man are to be
fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“What must be, must be,” said I, “and there
is none can gainsay that.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Eva,” said Grace O’Malley, “the end is as it
is appointed from the beginning.” Then she began
to reason gently with her foster-sister, and to show
her that if the English found they had good
reason to fear her they would gladly consent before
long to make peace, and to concede what she had
asked of Sir Nicholas.</p>

<p>But it was easy to see that my dear was sad
and heavy of heart. Grace, ever most tender to
her, put her arms about her, and made her sit
beside her on a couch, and said many loving
words, so that Eva was comforted, albeit some of
her brightness vanished from that day, never to
return. Although she had already shown how
brave she was, and was to exhibit a courage far
greater than my own or that of any man I ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
knew&mdash;her courage being that born of the spirit
and ours but of the body&mdash;she sure was never
made for that hard life of ours.</p>

<p>Gentle and sweet was she, yet the strain of
the O’Malley blood ran in her veins, and made
itself felt whenever the trials of her strength came.</p>

<p>Leaving the two ladies together, each went to
his place in the ships. Some of my men, who
had been ashore, now returned and informed me
that they had learned that it was the annual
custom to light a great fire on the headland of
Arran, on which stand the ruins of the ancient
castle called Dun Aengus, as soon as the vessels
of the wine fleet hove into sight.</p>

<p>The smoke of this fire, if it were day, or the
flame of it, if it were night, was a signal to the
merchants of Galway, who, as soon as they saw
it, made preparations for the reception of the ships&mdash;this
being the chief event each year in the life
of the town. To the end that the office of this
beacon should be better fulfilled, they had placed
a small body of soldiers and others in huts that
stood between the crumbling walls of the old fort.</p>

<p>I debated with myself whether it would not
be more prudent to have the lighting or the not
lighting of the fire in my own power, but, being
in no little doubt, put the matter off until later
in the day. By the middle of the afternoon, however,
there were abundant evidences that the weather,
which had for days past been fine, was about to
change; and as the sun fell, dark clouds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
gathering sullenly in the sky, the wind from the south-west
was blowing stormily across the island&mdash;though
our galleys felt it not at all, being under the lee
of the land&mdash;and already we could hear the thunder
of the waves as they rushed upon the further coast.
And all the night through a tempest of terrible
violence raged.</p>

<p>When the morning came, the fury of the gale
rather increased than diminished, and so that day
and the next, when the winds and waves began
to subside, we remained at anchor in our harbour,
safe from the storm. On the night of the third
day the wind died down to a breeze, and the
moon struggled fitfully through the scud and drift
of the clouds.</p>

<p>Uncertain as to how the storm might shift,
the galleys had been kept ready to put out from
the shore at any moment, and therefore it fell
out that nothing had been done by us with regard
to the Galway men at Dun Aengus. In the middle
watch, it being very dark save when the moon
shone out, to be hidden again as fast as it appeared,
we saw a bright tongue of flame shoot up,
flashing and shining brightly against the blackness
of the sky. Quickly raising our anchors, we made
off past the island of Inishmaan, and on by Inisheer
until we ran close in by the point of Trawkeera.</p>

<p>I wondered how it was that on such a night
the watchman at Dun Aengus had made out the
coming of the fleet, but discovered as we went
upon our course, that another beacon had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
lit far down the southern coast, and as soon as
they had seen it they had set a torch to their
own. Thus were we also apprised of the coming
of the wine fleet, and that by the hands of the
people of Galway themselves, as it were. As the
day began to dawn, greyly and drearily, a large,
unwieldy Spanish galleon entered the South Sound,
about half a league outside of Trawkeera. Not
more than half her sails were set, and she rolled
heavily from side to side in the swell left by the
storm. A few sleepy sailors stood in the waist
of the ship, and no armed watch was to be seen.</p>

<p>It had been arranged between Grace O’Malley
and myself that I was to attack the first vessel
that came in sight, and in the still, spectral light,
we stole silently out from the shadow of Inisheer,
the one great mainsail of <i>The Cross of Blood</i> being
set, and the oars shipped until the word was
given.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE CAPTURE OF THE <i>CAPITANA</i>.</small></h2>


<p>As we crept on towards the unsuspecting merchant
ship, I noticed that she presented a battered appearance,
as if she had felt the full fury of the storm
which we had ridden out so safely, and that she
had not come out of it without much damage.</p>

<p>The foremast had been broken off, and now a
great spar lashed to the stump had taken its place.
About the middle of the vessel the bulwark showed
a breach some five feet in length, and a piece of
rough sailcloth had been fastened carelessly over it,
so that the ragged edges of the broken wood were
plainly seen jutting out from under it.</p>

<p>Doubtless the sailors were worn out with the
stress of the working of their ship through the
tempest, and this also accounted for the slackness
of the watch and the ghostly quietness on board.</p>

<p>Otherwise, she was a splendid ship, the like of
which was seen at no other time in these seas, save
only when the wine fleet came each year to Galway.
She was built with high castles both at the stern
and at the bows; and she was, perhaps, of two
hundred tons’ burthen, according to the measure of
the English.</p>

<p>Her name, cut out of solid wood and painted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
deep blue, was the <i>Capitana</i>. She flew the flag of
Philip of Spain, and along with it at the stern
were to be seen the ensigns of some gentlemen
adventurers, who were in her, and who probably
commanded her fighting men, or who had accompanied
the expedition merely for the sake of
seeing another part of the world.</p>

<p>For the galleon’s defence against the rovers of
of the sea, who were to be found in great numbers
off the French and English coasts, she showed her
teeth in the guise of the black muzzles of twelve
cannon, all formidable ordnance, and, armed with
this equipment, as compared with that of <i>The Cross
of Blood</i>, looked as if she might devour us at her
leisure and with the utmost ease.</p>

<p>But it was not my purpose that these guns
should ever be pointed at us, and so high were
they out of the water&mdash;far above us, in fact&mdash;that
there was no such terrible danger to be apprehended
on this score. Besides, we were now too near her,
and she was, in any case, unprepared.</p>

<p>When we had approached within four hundred
yards of the <i>Capitana</i>, I gave orders that the sail
of <i>The Cross of Blood</i> should be lowered to the deck
quickly, and yet as quietly as might be, and that the
rowers should get them to their oars, and speed us
with all their might towards the Spanish ship.</p>

<p>So well was this effected that we were but, as it
seemed, a stone’s throw from her, and the beak of
the galley, as she rose to the swell, pointed straight
for the breach made by the storm in the waist of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
galleon, when the watch on board of her had their
suspicions all too tardily aroused. If they had heard
the noise made by the running of the tackle when
the sail was got down, they had not grasped its
meaning; but they could hardly fail to guess readily
enough what our appearance indicated as we dashed
towards them, our deck showing an array of arquebusiers
and spearmen, standing to their weapons.</p>

<p>The men of the <i>Capitana</i> began to rush to and
fro, and suddenly the clear notes of a trumpet blared
forth from her poop&mdash;the all-too-late summons to
arms. Her helmsmen, now alert to the danger which
menaced them, endeavoured to swing her round on
her heel into the wind, so as to keep us off.</p>

<p>We had stopped rowing, and our men were resting
with their hands on the heads and handles of their
oars, waiting for the order to ship them, when, as
the Spaniard went about, her side caught the oars
on the right side of the galley, and I heard the sharp
cracking and splintering of the wood of which they
were made as they were broken in pieces, and the
piercing cries, most lamentable to the ear, of the
rowers as they were knocked from their benches
and jammed together, a huddled, mangled mass
of shrieking and cursing, of wounded and dying
men.</p>

<p>Amid the din and outcry which attended this
disaster to us, there arose the voice of Calvagh
O’Halloran, the master of the rowers, encouraging,
directing, and calming the others. What had befallen
us was a serious matter, as it deprived us of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
any hope of getting away from the <i>Capitana</i> if our
attack should prove unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I ran along the deck, telling our people to be of
good heart, as all would yet be well; and, as nothing
so inspired them as the war-cry of their tribe and
the lust of fighting, I shouted loud and clear&mdash;</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley! O’Malley!”</p>

<p>The swinging of the Spaniard fended the galley
off from her, so that there was a clear space for the
breadth of a couple of oars, or a little more. As
Calvagh got the rowers at work again, and <i>The Cross
of Blood</i> went forward, the sides of the two ships
grated together with a shock. They ground apart
once again, and the water swished and swirled
between them, foaming white and flecked with red
as the blood of the rowers who had been injured
dripped from the galley.</p>

<p>“On board, on board!” I cried. “A ring of gold
to him who first boards her!” and I threw my battle-axe
among her sailors. “Follow that!” I said.</p>

<p>The Irish were howling about me like hungry
wolves, and <i>The Cross of Blood</i> shivered and trembled
like a living thing as the rowers, Calvagh at their
head, rushed from the benches, eager to revenge
themselves for the death of their comrades of the
oar, yelling hoarsely&mdash;</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley! O’Malley!”&mdash;the words
stinging the ear like blows.</p>

<p>Now the sides of the vessels strained and groaned
as again they smote together. The grappling-irons
were fastened as they touched each other, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
regardless of the thrusts made at us, we together
clambered up the <i>Capitana’s</i> side, entering by the
breach over which the sailcloth had been stretched,
and were immediately engaged in a hot and bloody
fight, the issue of which stood in no kind of doubt
from its commencement, as we far outnumbered the
sailors in this part of the Spaniard.</p>

<p>One burly fellow came at me with a pike, but
so uncertainly that I caught it from him with my
left hand, and ran him through with the sword in
my right. He dropped without a sound at my feet.</p>

<p>But while this contest was going on, and we were
sweeping all before us, we soon were made to feel
that, while so far successful, we were yet in a position
of the greatest peril; for we were now assailed by
shots from arquebuses fired down upon us both from
the castle at the bows and that at the poop as well,
and the air hummed with the arrows of our foes.</p>

<p>As there was no cover or protection of any kind
where we stood, divers of our men fell sorely
wounded, and some were slain outright. What the
event was to bring forth then seemed nothing but
our destruction, for we were caught, as it were, in
a trap, and that one of our own making.</p>

<p>The doors leading into the castles were both
shut, and, I conjectured, barricaded by this time
against us. However, to remain where we were
was to be slaughtered like cattle, and the attempt
had to be made to force these entrances. The
principal array of the enemy was in the poop castle,
and I instantly decided that it must be stormed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
else we should all perish miserably, and to break
in the door was the readiest way.</p>

<p>Calling on the Irish to follow me, I strode across
the slippery deck, a bullet narrowly missing me, to
the arched doorway through which lay the way to
the castle on the poop.</p>

<p>Whether it was that our assault had been so little
looked for, or that what had already taken place had
occupied so brief a breath, as one may say&mdash;for
who can take count of time in the heat of battle?&mdash;I
know not; but this entrance had not been
strongly secured, for hurling myself impetuously
with all my force against the barrier I burst the
door open, and that so violently and quickly that
I had much ado to keep myself from stumbling,
and so being trampled upon and killed by my own
men. Recovering myself with an effort, I found
myself in a wide chamber, in which there were
tables and chests and other furniture, but not a
single soul was to be seen.</p>

<p>At one end of it was a flight of steps leading
up to the deck of the castle. Stopping my men,
I bade them wait in this sheltered room while I
ascended the steps, and reached another large cabin,
also deserted as far as I could see, while above
me I heard the trampling of many feet. Summoning
my followers, I dashed up a second flight of
steps, the Irish, who gave tongue like bloodhounds
tracking deer, pushing in and swarming up behind
me.</p>

<p>I was like enough to have paid for my rashness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
with my life, for as I emerged upon the deck of
the poop, the point of a sword flashed off my body-armour,
and I received so shrewd a buffet upon
my shoulder from a mace or battle-axe of some
kind, that I nearly lost my footing, and, as it was,
would have done so but for the press of men behind
me.</p>

<p>As I appeared a crowd of Spaniards rushed upon
me from all sides, praying to Our Lady and all
the saints for their aid, and above all naming
“Santiago.”</p>

<p>Now sweeping my sword in a great shining
circle round my head, now stabbing and hacking
and cleaving, while my strength seemed to grow
with my necessity, I held them at bay, albeit in
what way I escaped the deadly thrusts of spears
and pikes, and the bullets aimed at me at such
close quarters, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>Two or three slight wounds did I receive, and
the sight of my own blood drove me into a perfect
fury of killing, and rendered me regardless of
myself; but as for the wounds themselves I heeded
them not, and indeed in the fiery heat of that
encounter scarce felt them at all. Soon, however,
would I have been overborne and destroyed, if I
had not been joined by Calvagh and the others,
who charged upon the enemy with inconceivable
fury.</p>

<p>Nothing could have stood before the tremendous
outpouring of such incredible rage.</p>

<p>The gallant men of Spain fought on, and met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
us bravely, brave with something more than the
courage which is born of dark despair. For, to
say the truth, never yet saw I any of that nation&mdash;even
of its commonalty&mdash;that might be called a
coward.</p>

<p>It is my belief, and good reason have I for it,
that no more doughty men ever wielded sword or
pike than those of Spain, nor were there any better
sailors in those days in all the world. There be
many, who, having regard to what she was&mdash;this
great power of Spain&mdash;and considering what has
happened to her, and how she is now shorn in no
small degree of her glory, can account for it in
no other way than by saying that she lieth under
the Wrath of God. Howbeit, this is too high a
matter for me. Only know I full well that the
crew of the <i>Capitana</i>, whether fighting men or
sailors, made such a stern and grim battle against
us that grey morning in the Bay of Galway, as
the most valiant knights could not have bettered.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the poop there rose up a
mast, and around this our enemies gathered in a
cluster, among them being some half-armed men
whom I took to be the adventurers whose ensigns
floated beside the standard of the galleon, and who
carried themselves with an air.</p>

<p>They had had no time to have their armour put
upon them and fastened with proper care, but as
they proved themselves to be accomplished swordsmen
they made a determined resistance to us. If
they had come at me when I appeared at the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of the steps, I should never have reached the deck
of the poop alive; they had, however, tarried too
long in the attempt to be clothed with their harness.</p>

<p>They were surrounded, and, though I offered
them their lives, declaring that they would be held
for ransom and would be well treated by Grace
O’Malley, they would not listen to me, preferring
rather to die, fighting, so long as the breath was
in them, like the valiant men of Spain they were.</p>

<p>One only, who appeared to be the captain of the
ship, I commanded to be taken alive&mdash;a business
which was done with difficulty, so madly did he
struggle, notwithstanding that the blood flowed in
streams from several of his wounds.</p>

<p>“Yield yourself,” said I, “Señor Captain, for the
ship is ours, and further fighting is useless. Give
me your parole.”</p>

<p>But he refused, snarling and showing his teeth
like a mad dog. Then I ordered him to be bound,
and laid on the deck for the present.</p>

<p>The greater part of the galleon was now in our
hands, but there still remained a band of Spaniards
in the forecastle, who galled us with the fire from
their pieces and the arrows of their bows. When
they saw how their comrades had been overcome
on the poop castle, they cut down the spar which
had been lashed to the broken foremast, and using
it and the sailcloth about it as a kind of barricade
went on firing at us from behind this shelter.</p>

<p>Telling Calvagh, who had come out of the fight
without a scratch, to take what men he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
needful, I directed him to attack the forecastle, and
at the same time protected his assault of it by
a discharge from the poop of a small cannon I
found there loaded. This position of the Spaniards,
however, was one of such strength that they inflicted
heavy loss upon us before they were all put
to the sword.</p>

<p>We were now masters of the entire vessel, but
its capture had cost us dear. Fifteen of the Irish
were killed, and as many more wounded, several of
them seriously; and when the sun rose across the
dim outline of the hills away beyond Galway its
rays fell upon decks that ran dark with blood, and
upon a wearied band of men, whose gasping breath
came and went in sobs of pain, now that the excitement
was past, and who threw themselves down in
sheer exhaustion. I myself was sore spent, but the
day was only begun, and the rest of the wine fleet
might come into view at any moment. Therefore
I bade my men rise up as soon as they had rested
somewhat, and then endeavoured to put the <i>Capitana</i>
into sailing trim.</p>

<p>While this was being done I shaped our course
for Inisheer, remaining on the <i>Capitana</i> myself with
some of my crew, and sending Calvagh to take charge
of <i>The Cross of Blood</i>. I also had the captain of the
galleon brought before me, to see if I could get any
information from him about the other ships of the
fleet.</p>

<p>“Señor Captain,” said I, “the chance of war has
delivered you and your ship to me. Ye fought well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and I am grieved that so many valiant souls no
longer see the light; yet would I have spared them,
as many as I could, but they would not. You are
in no danger of your life, if you will but answer the
questions I ask of you.”</p>

<p>I spoke in English, my knowledge of Spanish
being slight, but I judged that the captain of a
ship trading to Ireland, and particularly to the
English city of Galway, would be certain to understand
the English tongue. At first it appeared,
however, as if he did not comprehend my words.</p>

<p>“Kill me, kill me!” he exclaimed in Spanish,
while his face was distorted with impotent rage.</p>

<p>Replying to him mildly that I had no intention
of putting him to death, I informed him that I had
no sufficient acquaintance with his own language,
and therefore I was unable to converse with him
in it.</p>

<p>“You surely understand English,” said I.</p>

<p>One of the Irish who was on guard over him
thrust a dagger into him for an inch or more before
I knew what he would be about, whereupon the
Spaniard cursed him and us and himself and his
ship and the day he was born in as good English
as ever I heard.</p>

<p>“I shall tell you nothing,” said he. “No, by
St. Jago, nothing, nothing, nothing!”</p>

<p>I felt a pity for the man, and told one of those
standing near me to fetch him some wine, and
that as speedily as might be, and again asked
him if he were resolved to die; but he merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
glared at me like a wild animal, and I left him
alone, reserving him to be questioned by Grace
O’Malley.</p>

<p>When the wine was brought he drank it thirstily,
saying, “If it is poisoned, so much the better.”</p>

<p>And now we drew near again to Inisheer. Rounding
the Point of Trawkeera, we dropped anchor
beside the two other galleys, and my mistress came
on board of our prize. When I told her of the
great fight the Spaniards had made, and what it had
cost us to take the ship, she sighed and became
pensive.</p>

<p>“We can ill afford so many men,” she said, “but
the other ships of the wine fleet may be captured or
destroyed more easily. Bring the captain of the
galleon to me, and let me see if I can learn anything
from him of his companions.”</p>

<p>“He will say nothing,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley’s face grew dark, but she merely
repeated her command. When the Spanish captain
was fetched in, he was struck with amazement when
he beheld a woman, young, handsome, and, as some
thought, beautiful, who appeared to be the chief
and leader of us all. At first he gazed at her as
one who sees an apparition or a phantom.</p>

<p>“Madre de Dios! Madre de Dios!” he said aloud
in his astonishment, and for some time acted as
one might who suspected that his sense of sight
was playing him a trick. He was faint and pale
from loss of blood, and presented a piteous appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Free him from his bonds,” said Grace O’Malley,
and I cut away the thongs that held him.</p>

<p>“Señor Captain,” continued she when this had
been done, “I have a quarrel with the Governor
of Connaught and the people of Galway, who have
treated me despitefully,&mdash;therefore has your galleon
been taken.”</p>

<p>“You, Señorita!” he said.</p>

<p>“I was beguiled with fair words and promises,”
said she, “and then they made me a prisoner, but
I escaped from them. War have I declared against
them, and a great revenge shall I take. You, I hear,
are a brave man, and I have need of such in this
contest with the English. Will you join me?”</p>

<p>“That will I not,” said he; and I heard him
muttering to himself, “She is a devil.”</p>

<p>“Better consider before you speak,” said I, seizing
his arm roughly.</p>

<p>“Let me be, let me be,” said he, “for I am a
dying man!” And he swooned upon the deck.
Reviving in a few minutes, he staggered to his feet,
whereupon I put my arm round him for his support.</p>

<p>“Where are the other ships of the fleet, tell me,”
said Grace O’Malley, “and how many are there?”</p>

<p>“You can kill me,” said he, “and I shall thank
you for it, but that which I know I shall never
tell you.”</p>

<p>And again I heard him muttering, “Devil, devil!”
and calling upon “Santiago” to protect him from her
spells.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley gazed at him, and of a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
there was in her eyes&mdash;what I never looked to see
in them on such an occasion&mdash;a dew of tears springing
from an unsuspected fount of pity. After all,
she was a woman, as I have said.</p>

<p>“You are a brave man and a true,” said she, “and
I will not plague you more. Let him die in peace,”
cried she to me, “if die he must.”</p>

<p>As I was about to place him with his back against
a mast so as to ease him, he made a snatch at the
dagger which was in my belt; his fingers closed over
it, but even as he grasped it his lips parted and his
spirit fled.</p>

<p>“God rest thee, thou gallant mariner of Spain!”
said Grace O’Malley, when she saw that the captain
of the galleon was dead.</p>

<p>“Amen,” cried I, for the firmness of the man had
seemed to me a very noble thing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>A CHEST OF GOLD.</small></h2>


<p>The day had worn on to noon but without its
brightness, for the sky had again become full of
heavy clouds driven up from the west; the wind
moaned and raved over land and sea, and the waves
beat drearily upon the shore. The thunder rolled
and the lightning flashed, while the pelting rain came
down in huge drops that sounded on our decks like
hail or the cracking of whips.</p>

<p>The ensanguined waters flowed in floods from the
planking and the sides of the captured galleon,
which lay like some great wounded monster of the
deep, sweating blood. Closer into the land we
steered, and so saved ourselves from the worst of
the gale.</p>

<p>For the present all thoughts of searching for the
other vessels of the fleet had to be given up, and
fain was I to rest, for my wounds, though slight, were
sore, and the dull aching of my shoulder was hard
to bear. Seeing my state, Grace O’Malley bade me
go to her own galley, where Eva would attend to
my wounds with her gentle fingers, and then,
perhaps, sing me to sleep with one of the songs of
her people.</p>

<p>This command went so well with every beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of my heart that my pains were all but forgotten,
and when I reached <i>The Grey Wolf</i>, Eva met me,
and waited upon me, and made so much of the
“Mountain of a Man,” as she often called me, that
the only pangs I felt were those caused by my love
for her&mdash;so much so that the tale of it was trembling
on my lips, though I could not for the life of me
put it into words, but dumbly looked, and longing&mdash;looked
again and again at her.</p>

<p>Fool that I was, dolt that I was, not to have
spoken then! But my tongue was tied, as with a
ribbon of steel, and if one were to ask me why this
was, I could not tell, nor can I now, looking back
across the blunt edge of years. Yet here was such
an opportunity, if I could have grasped it, but it
passed.</p>

<p>Eva sang softly to me as I lay with my harness
off on a couch, until I fell a-sleeping and a-dreaming,
and all through the sleeping and the dreaming did
I hear the sound of her singing, far off, indistinctly,
and murmurous, like that of the brooks among the
silent hills.</p>

<p>When I awoke, it was evening, and both she and
Grace O’Malley were seated by my side. The storm
had abated, and already a weak, watery moon was
riding in the heavens, and, as I opened my eyes, its
faint beams fell whitely upon the faces of my mistresses,
so that to me, being still only half awake,
they looked like spirits. I rose to a sitting posture,
and felt that my strength had come back
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has your weariness left you?” asked Grace
O’Malley, smiling kindly at me.</p>

<p>For answer I stretched my limbs and my body,
and smiled at her without speaking, though the pain
in my shoulder still troubled me, and I could not
move without feeling it.</p>

<p>“While you have slept, Ruari,” she went on, “I
have gone over as much of the galleon as might be
in the hours of daylight at my disposal, and the
riches in her are truly wonderful. Never saw I so
great a store of all manner of things of value in a
ship before. ’Tis a splendid spoil, and the merchants
of Galway will have good cause to remember me,
and Sir Nicholas will be beside himself with rage.”</p>

<p>“We have not yet finished with them or with
Sir Nicholas,” said I. “The <i>Capitana</i> is not the
only ship of the wine fleet.”</p>

<p>“Neither has Sir Nicholas done with us, I fear,”
said Eva, sadly, “nor the people of Galway.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it seems to me, Eva,” said Grace to
her foster-sister, “as if you were only half an
O’Malley.” Then she turned to me again. “Ruari,
I have more to tell about the galleon. On board of
her there is a chest of gold&mdash;all money of Spain,
coined pieces, bearing the effigy of the late Emperor,
Charles. Now, hearken! A strange, wild story goes
with this chest of gold, and there is that in it which
may concern us very closely.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, my interest being keenly stirred
as I guessed from the slow and almost solemn way
in which she addressed me, that she had stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
probably on some mystery of the sea&mdash;something,
at any rate, unexpected and out of the way, and yet
something that might touch us nearly. “Yes,” I
said, watching her intently, “it is naught of evil
import for us, surely?”</p>

<p>“That I know not as yet,” she replied. “Rather
does it portend a benefit; time alone can tell. This
is how we came to find the gold, and we might never
have gotten it of ourselves&mdash;we were told of it.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“While our search through the galleon was being
made, two men, bound in fetters and chained together,
were discovered in a small, dark den, low
down in the ship; a hole, indeed, so cunningly concealed
from observation that even the very sailors
on board the <i>Capitana</i> might not have known of
its existence, if its being hidden from them were
deemed necessary or expedient. The men were
half-starved, and so utterly wretched that when they
were brought into the light they were as the blind,
and gibbered like idiots. What they say, now that
they have come to themselves, is pitiful enough, and
I believe they are telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked I, as she meditated on
their story. “What account do they give of themselves?
You have said nothing about the chest of
gold.”</p>

<p>“One of them,” said she “tells me that he is a
Geraldine, a near relative of Garrett, Earl of
Desmond.”</p>

<p>“An Irishman!” I broke in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, so he says, and I doubt it not,” said she.
“The other is a Spaniard, Don Francisco de Vilela
by name, a man of rank, if one may judge of him
from his speech and carriage. But you will see them
yourself shortly.”</p>

<p>“What is their explanation of their being prisoners
on board of the galleon? Is it concerned with the
chest of gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so they say,” she replied; “and they relate
that before the <i>Capitana</i> left Spain they made a
bargain with its captain to convey them to Ireland
for a certain sum of money, which they paid over
to him before he put out from port. Their compact
with him was that they were to be landed at some
lonely point or secluded place on our western coasts,
and not at any town, such as Limerick or Galway.”</p>

<p>“Why was that?” I asked. “Doubtless the
captain of the galleon made a similar inquiry of
them.”</p>

<p>“They say he asked them no questions whatever,”
replied she; “but he must have understood that they
had some business of a very private nature, probably
concerned with State affairs. Evidently that business
lay with the native Irish, and not with the English,
from whom they wished their movements to be kept
secret, else would there have been no need to have
avoided any of the English towns in Ireland.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said I, for I could not help seeing
the drift of her words, “that they are the bearers of
some message from the King of Spain to the Earl of
Desmond, or some other chief of the Irish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do not fall very short of the mark,” said
she.</p>

<p>“But,” asked I, “how came it about, or what
happened to cause them to be thrust into chains, and
that on board a Spanish ship? Those who brought a
message from the Spanish King would surely have
been well-treated, and even honoured, by the captain
of a ship coming out of Spain. Plainly, there is
something here which fits not in with their narration.”</p>

<p>“They say that it was because of the chest of
gold,” she replied. “The captain is dead, so that we
shall never hear his version of the affair, but they
affirm he could not withstand the temptation of the
gold. Brave, as we know he was, and an excellent
sailor, as they say he was reputed to be, yet would he
have sold his very soul for gold.”</p>

<p>“How did he know of it?”</p>

<p>“So heavy a chest could hardly have been
brought on board without his knowledge, and to
conjecture what it contained was no such difficult
matter. They did not conceal from him their anxiety
for its safe-keeping, and one or other of them was
always on guard over it. Anyone would have known,
therefore, that it held a treasure of some kind. All
went well until they reached the coast of Kerry,
when, reminding the captain of their agreement with
him, they requested him to send them, the chest, and
the rest of their belongings ashore in a boat. The
sea was very rough, however, and he assured them
the thing was impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>“That might well have been the case,” said I.</p>

<p>“They therefore confided to him&mdash;what he most
likely knew already&mdash;that they had come over on a
secret embassy from the King of Spain, and besought
him, by his fidelity to his King, to put them ashore.
He protested that their landing at the time would be
attended with difficulty, and even danger, and again
refused their request.</p>

<p>“They expostulated with him, but in vain; he was
not to be moved, having already, they say, determined
that they should never deliver their message.
Next they offered him a large sum of money, and,
when he asked where they were to get it from, told
him of the gold, but without informing him of the
amount they had in the chest. Still, he would not
give way, and, at length, on their continuing to urge
him, he became sullen, angry and abusive, hurling
many hurtful words at them in his wrath. His real
reason, they began to fear, was not the roughness of
the sea, for some sheltered bay or inlet with calm
water might have easily been reached, had he so
desired, but that he had resolved to possess himself of
their treasure.”</p>

<p>“They had played into his hands by speaking of
the contents of the chest,” I said.</p>

<p>“That was their mistake, and they have had to repent
themselves of it. That same night, while they
slept, they were seized, put into manacles, and
thrown into the close and filthy den in which they
were discovered by us.</p>

<p>“They saw the captain but once after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
imprisonment, and he had told them&mdash;for their comfort&mdash;that
it had been his original intention to fling them
overboard, but that he had changed his mind, and
would deliver them up, instead, to the English
Governor of Connaught, when the ship arrived at
Galway, as plotters against the peace of Ireland.
Then they never would be heard of again, for all men
knew of what sort of stuff Sir Nicholas Malby was
made, and how short and sharp were his dealings
with those who conspired against the Queen, once
they were in his power.”</p>

<p>This was an evil hearing in regard to one who in
his dying had shown a not unmanly kind of virtue;
but who is there that does not know that gold is for
most men the god of the whole earth? The story of
the two struck me as being true, as it was stamped
through and through with a sort of human naturalness.
And I said as much.</p>

<p>“When the captain told them,” continued Grace
O’Malley, “of the fate in store for them, they offered
him all the gold they had in the chest if only he
would let them go. But he answered them that it
was his already, and that he had no intention of
parting with it. If they lived, he would never feel
safe&mdash;and the dead had no tongue. Hearing this,
they gave up all hope, and abandoned themselves to
the gloom of despair, cursing the captain for his
perfidy.</p>

<p>“Then the storm came on, and the galleon drove
hither and thither with the tempest. Their wretchedness
increased, until they reflected that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
better to perish by drowning than to live to undergo
the torture and miserable death which Sir Nicholas
would be certain to inflict upon them.”</p>

<p>“The tale,” I said, when I had pondered it for a
few minutes, “does not sound to me as if it were
false.”</p>

<p>“It was so far confirmed,” said Grace O’Malley,
“inasmuch as the chest of gold, the possession of
which worked their undoing, lay concealed in the
cabin which the captain had occupied. For safe-keeping
I had it removed to this galley.”</p>

<p>“Did they tell you,” said I, my thoughts reverting
to what, after all, was the most important part of
their statements, “what was the burden of their
message from the King of Spain?”</p>

<p>“Not fully,” she replied, “and I forebore from
questioning them more narrowly until they had recovered.
They did say that Philip wishes well to
Ireland, or rather, he loves not the English, who
condemn him to his face, and singe his very beard.
They hinted that the King had sent Don Francisco
to spy out the land, and to become acquainted with
the wishes of the princes and chiefs of the island.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose? To what end?”</p>

<p>“To encourage them to rebel against the Queen,
by giving them such help as is within his power.
At the same time, he does not wish to appear
to be concerned in the affairs of Ireland at all.”</p>

<p>I had heard of Philip before as a man who
was uncertain of purpose and infirm of will, timid
when he should have been bold, and bold when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
he should have been timid; one who covered himself
and his designs with a cloak of clumsy cunning
which it required no skill to see through, and of
deceit which deceived none of the least discerning
of his enemies. Therefore said I not a word, but
contented myself to wait for what my mistress
might say further on the matter.</p>

<p>She was silent, however, and I could see from
her rapt, indrawn look, that her thoughts had wandered
far away from us and the galleys and the
wine fleet&mdash;perhaps to Spain and its shifty King.
I, too, was busy thinking, and, as I conceived that
we had affairs immediately before us of more importance
than even Philip of Spain, I made bold
to interrupt her reveries.</p>

<p>“We can at least gather from the two men,”
said I, “how many ships were in the wine fleet.
The rest of them cannot now be far off from us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, rousing herself from her musings
like one from slumber, “they informed me
that there were nine galleons in the fleet when
they left Cadiz, four of them were bound for
Limerick and five for Galway.”</p>

<p>“Then there are still four ships for us to fight,”
I exclaimed. “Let the chest of gold and the
King of Spain wait, say I. Would it not be well,
now that the wind has fallen, to send one of the
galleys to keep a look-out?”</p>

<p>“Tibbot the Pilot,” she replied, “already watches
the Sound in <i>The Winged Horse</i>. The galleons
will most likely have been separated from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
other by the recent storms, but if any one of them
comes into sight we will quickly be apprised of it.”</p>

<p>“Have you not had enough of fighting for one
day?” asked Eva.</p>

<p>“We have vowed vengeance on Galway,” I said,
and Eva said no more, but sighed deeply.</p>

<p>There was a knocking at the door of the cabin,
and a servant entered with the message that Don
Francisco de Vilela and Dermot Fitzgerald desired
speech of Grace O’Malley, to thank her for her
kindness to them. Permission being granted, the
two men soon made their appearance. They had
eaten, had washed themselves, and were attired in
fresh clothes taken from the supplies on board
the galleon, and looked very different, I imagine,
from what they had done when they had emerged
from the hole in the <i>Capitana</i>, where they had
been imprisoned.</p>

<p>Both of them bowed with a profound reverence
to my mistresses, and I took note, even in the half-light,
of the contrast they made as they stood
together. The Irishman was fair and ruddy, the
Spaniard dark and swarthy as most Spaniards are.
Fitzgerald was tall&mdash;nearly as tall as myself&mdash;Don
Francisco of the middle height, but having a very
soldierly bearing and an air of resolution which
his comrade lacked. Thus much I saw at a
glance.</p>

<p>De Vilela was the first to speak, and his accent
had all the smooth deference of the court rather
than the rough sincerity of the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Señorita,” said he, “if you will suffer a poor
gentleman of Spain to offer you his thanks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said the Irishman, interrupting him
impulsively, “I never dreamt the day would come
when I should be glad to be a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” quoth Grace O’Malley, “no more
of that, I beg.”</p>

<p>The glance of the two men swept past her,
de Vilela’s to fasten on Eva O’Malley, Fitzgerald’s
on me, while my mistress made us known to each
other. Then they entreated her to say what was
her will in regard to them, and what ransom she
demanded for their release. But she replied that
she had not yet determined, and so put them off.</p>

<p>She conversed for some minutes with de Vilela,
speaking to him of the West Indies, whither, it
appeared, he had been in one of the very ships
for which Tibbot the Pilot was watching&mdash;the <i>San
Millan de Simancas</i>.</p>

<p>I now had had leisure to observe him more
closely, and he gave me the impression of a man
of high breeding. He discoursed with a tongue
of winning sweetness, more like a woman’s than a
man’s, and yet one had only to examine with a
little carefulness the lines of his face to be convinced
that these soft tones were like the fur over
claws, and that there was nothing else of the
feminine about him.</p>

<p>His companion, Fitzgerald, was of a very different
type, although he, too, was of knightly birth&mdash;rash,
unstable, easily swayed, but generous and warm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
heart, with quick, unstudied manners, and no
capacity for much besides the wielding of his sword.</p>

<p>Ever as the Spaniard spoke his dark, eloquent
eyes wandered from one to another of us, resting
with an absorbed intensity longest on Eva&mdash;a thing
in no wise to be wondered at, but which I did not
care to see, although I had no right to be jealous.</p>

<p>And then there broke upon the hush of the
night, now grown still and calm, the zip-zap-swish,
zip-zap-swish of the oars of a galley, quickly driven
by its rowers through the water; there was the
low, clear call of Tibbot as <i>The Winged Horse</i> came
up towards us, while at his word the oars hung
motionless and glistening in the pale moonlight,
and I went out to hear what tidings he brought.</p>

<p>He reported that the tops of the masts of two
large ships were to be seen on the horizon, and
that there might be more, as the light was but
faint owing to the clouds that still passed over the
sky. I hastened back to inform my mistress of
Tibbot’s news. The door of the cabin opened before
I had reached it and Grace O’Malley appeared upon
the scene, and as the door closed behind her I
saw that Don Francisco was speaking earnestly to
Eva, who, for her part, was listening to him with
deep attention.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A WOMAN’S WILE.</small></h2>


<p>“What news?” demanded Grace O’Malley.</p>

<p>Repeating Tibbot’s words to her, I asked what
her commands were.</p>

<p>“This afternoon while you slept, Ruari,” she
replied, “the idea of a certain artifice or stratagem
came into my mind, and the darkness of the night
is so much in favour of its successful issue that
there is no reason why it should not be attempted.
It was suggested to me as I went over the stores
of the galleon by the quantities of all manner of
garments on board of her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>So had spoken very rapidly, being conscious that
with the galleons not far away there was no time
to spare.</p>

<p>“Enough, at present,” she continued. “I will
tell you more of it when I have made a disposition
of our ships.”</p>

<p>“The prisoners?” I questioned. “They can
scarcely be expected to join us in an attack on
Spanish ships&mdash;even although these ships are in
reality more the property of the merchants of Galway
than of any others.”</p>

<p>“Transfer them,” said she, “to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>,
which I shall leave here under Calvagh’s charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
When you have seen them safely in his hands come
to me&mdash;I shall be on the <i>Capitana</i>.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Capitana</i>!” I exclaimed, surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she. “In a little while you will
see why I say the <i>Capitana</i>.”</p>

<p>I hurried off into the cabin, and telling Don
Francisco and Fitzgerald that they were to be put
for the night aboard of my galley, and having whispered
to Eva that there was something in the wind,
but that I knew not quite what it was, I conducted
the two men to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and delivered
them over to Calvagh, bidding him keep a close guard
over them. Then I got into a boat, and in a trice was
on the Spanish galleon’s deck.</p>

<p>Just as I reached it the clouds drifted from off
the face of the moon, and as I looked up around me
I could scarcely believe my eyes at what I saw.
Pausing not to think, I placed my hand upon my
sword, and had pulled it half-way out of its sheath,
when a voice which I recognised as Tibbot the Pilot’s,
sang out close to my ear, while there was a splutter of
laughter in his throat, as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Tis a wise man who sometimes doubts his seeing
aright, Ruari Macdonald. Know you not your friends
from your foes?”</p>

<p>Tibbot, I perceived, was not attired in the Irish
fashion, but had discarded his saffron mantle and his
long, wide-sleeved jacket, and had replaced them by a
sober Spanish suit, under which, one might be sure,
was a shirt of mail.</p>

<p>And now I noticed that the sailors who moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
about us, getting the galleon ready for sea, were
no more our own wild kernes of Mayo, but all
mariners of Spain!</p>

<p>“Tibbot,” said I, “what is the meaning of this?
Wherefore is this mummery?”</p>

<p>“’Tis by our mistress’s order,” said he, “and ’tis
herself will have good reason for it, I’m thinking.”
And his cheeks creased with laughter.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley had said something of a stratagem,&mdash;was
this it? One quicker of apprehension than
myself would have seen what her intentions were,
but I had to go and ask her for an explanation.</p>

<p>And, lo, on the poop deck, where a few hours
before there had been so great a struggle, I found
not my mistress, but a youthful, handsome, smiling,
debonair knight of Spain, who yet had the eyes and
the accents of our princess! By her side there stood
the captain of the <i>Capitana</i>, risen from the dead&mdash;or
such a passable imitation of him in face and figure
as might well have deceived the living.</p>

<p>I stared stupidly at them both,&mdash;and then I
understood. For the nonce, we were no longer
O’Malleys or other free Irish rovers of the sea, but
dons and señors&mdash;if you please,&mdash;soldiers and sailors
under the flag of Spain; the <i>Capitana</i> for the time
being had not been taken, but was still bound in all
security for the port of Galway&mdash;only haply, that
being stayed by storms, she had taken shelter behind
the island of Arran, from which she would presently
emerge to meet the other galleons as they came up.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;the thing was plain enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman’s wit is a wonderful thing, and well is it
for us men that the loves and the hates of women do
dim the brightness of it, else would we be dazzled and
blind and dumb all our days, and our strength be
but a vain thing.</p>

<p>“What think you of my plot?” said the young
gentleman adventurer, this Spanish knight, who was
my mistress.</p>

<p>“You are a great magician, señor!” said I, taking
her humour. “And what would you with this Ruari
Macdonald&mdash;once the sworn servant of an Irish princess,
known as Grace O’Malley?”</p>

<p>“By my faith,” cried she, “I would not have him
changed for all the world.”</p>

<p>And the words were dear to me, so that my heart
glowed within me&mdash;even as it does now at the memory
of them.</p>

<p>Then she spoke to me with some fulness of the
snare she was preparing for the two galleons, now
beating up towards the Sound.</p>

<p>It was the case, no doubt, said she, that the five
ships of the wine fleet had been scattered over the
western seas by the storm, but those Tibbot had
seen had managed to keep by each other or had come
together again, and were travelling as slowly as possible,
with a view to picking up their companion vessel,
and, further, that their sailing powers would most
probably have been reduced by the damage wrought
upon them by the tempest.</p>

<p>Her purpose was to stand off and on in the
Sound, manœuvring the <i>Capitana</i> in such a way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to indicate that she had also suffered from the violence
of the weather; to allow the ships to come up within
near hail of her&mdash;which they would be certain to do,
as they could have no suspicion of what had befallen
the <i>Capitana</i>, especially as they would be able to see
nothing strange in the appearance of the galleon or in
the dress of those on board of her&mdash;and then to trust
to the chances of the hour for the rest.</p>

<p>When I raised the objection that this plot of hers
necessitated the absence of the galleys from the
attack, she replied that no more than a bare guard
had been left on board of them, and that she had
as many as eighty men out of them, and had placed
them on the <i>Capitana</i>, a number which she thought
more than sufficient for the enterprise.</p>

<p>“If all goes well,” said she, “I will myself lead the
assault on the first ship, and Tibbot on the other&mdash;if
they have to be fought together at the same time; do
you remain on the <i>Capitana</i>, for she must be seen to
by one who is a seaman, and much may depend on
the way in which she is managed. Besides, you must
still be weary of the fight of a few hours ago. But
circumstances will guide us.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said I, “there is no need for you to
expose yourself, and my fatigue is gone.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay!” said she, “let the thing stand.”</p>

<p>The anchor was gotten up, and out beyond the
point of Trawkeera went the ship, the moon now
shining more clearly, and the stars showing here
and there like diamonds through a scarf of clouds.
And there, not more than a mile away, loomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
up the two galleons for which we were on the
watch.</p>

<p>The wind was light, and the sails of the galleon,
which was the nearer of the two to us, showed up
in grey shadows against the velvety black of the sky.
She was of the usual build of the merchant ship of
Cadiz, with the same lumbering breadth, the same
high castles at poop and bows, and the same rig in
every respect as had that which we had captured,
and was of much the same size. Some distance
behind her was her companion, and the two vessels
were so much alike that the second appeared to be
the double of the first.</p>

<p>As soon as we were within view, a lantern was
waved three times towards us from the bows of the
leading ship&mdash;a signal to which we responded by also
waving a lantern three times, surmising that some
such answering sign would be expected back in
return.</p>

<p>We waited with an anxious curiosity to see how
this would be taken, and as we saw the dark figures
of the watch hurrying, in evident alarm, to the
bulwarks to gaze at us, and heard their voices raised
in discussion coming faintly across the waters, we
could not fail to understand that some other token
had been looked for.</p>

<p>In their perplexity they knew not what to make
of us, and we could see plainly enough that there was
an argument going on among them in respect of us.
As the distance between us slowly lessened, their
uncertainty and indecision were increased when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
beheld, as we took excellent care they should, a few
of the O’Malleys standing on the fore-deck of the
<i>Capitana</i>. Even had it been as bright as day, they
could not have imagined that they were other than
Spanish sailors like themselves.</p>

<p>Our men had been ordered to remain quite still
and silent, and under the moon, over which a web of
cloud was being spun, they appeared like figures
carved out of stone.</p>

<p>The watchman on the bows of the galleon hailed
us, and though his voice sounded clearly to us, we
pretended not to hear; he called again through the
quiet of the night, and when we returned no answer
we could see that he ran with a sort of terror of he
knew not what from his place, and was lost in the
darkness of the forecastle.</p>

<p>In the meantime we had come close up to her,
her sailors bending blanched, fear-stricken faces over
her bulwarks upon us, and perhaps thinking that
they saw before them the fabulous <i>Ship of Death</i>,
upon which for ever sail the souls of those foully
murdered on the sea, and which for the nonce had
taken on the form of the <i>Capitana</i> to lure them to
their doom, for never might human eyes behold that
dreaded sight and live.</p>

<p>The two ships were now so near each other that
it required but a touch of the helm and the quick
ringing word of command from Grace O’Malley&mdash;the
statues sprang to life, and a host of the
O’Malleys jumped on board the galleon at different
points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all the work of a twinkling, so soon was
the ship carried. The watch on deck were overpowered
and made prisoners with scarcely a blow
being struck. Tibbot crept through a window in the
poop of the Spaniard, and, followed by a dozen of
the Irish, had secured those who were asleep or
half-awakened before they could make any resistance.
In the forecastle alone was there any struggle,
for there a handful of men stood to their weapons,
and, refusing quarter, fought on till everyone of them
was slain.</p>

<p>I had watched with straining eyes through the
gloom for the form of that young Spanish knight
who was my mistress, and, not seeing it anywhere,
was in sore dismay; not many minutes, however,
went by&mdash;the action had moved with the speed with
which things change in a dream&mdash;when she appeared
on the poop, as I thought.</p>

<p>Nor was I mistaken, for she called to me to trim
the <i>Capitana</i> and to wear down upon the other
galleon, which had changed her course, and was
striving to make off southwards for the open sea.
Her watch had given the alarm, and we could see
the dark bodies of her crew and of her fighting men
making to their posts.</p>

<p>Sending back to me some of our Irish for the
better working of the <i>Capitana</i>, she caused the newly-captured
vessel to be released from the grapplings
and fastenings, by which I had had her bound to
us while the attack was going on, and we swung
apart. Crowding on sail in hot haste, we put about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and went in pursuit of the fleeing galleon, which not
only had the start of us, but now also appeared to be
a better sailer than either of us, as we did not gain
on her, but, on the contrary, rather fell back.</p>

<p>It was apparent that she would escape us if we
were to trust to our sailing powers alone. I had just
determined to train one of the cannon on board the
<i>Capitana</i> on to her, when a loud explosion shook
the air.</p>

<p>Of what had occurred, then and afterwards on
the <i>Santa Ana</i>, as the ship Grace O’Malley had
just taken was named, I was not a witness, nor
was Tibbot, who told me of it, either; but it is
narrated here just as I heard it.</p>

<p>Seeing that there was a likelihood of the galleon,
to which we were giving chase, showing us a clean
pair of heels, she ordered Tibbot to the helm of the
<i>Santa Ana</i>, and, telling him of what she intended,
she herself went among the prisoners, who were lying
bound in different parts of the ship.</p>

<p>Among them she found divers persons who understood
the Irish tongue, and them, by both promises
and threats, she compelled to bring before her the
master of the ordnance and those who assisted him
in loading and firing the cannon. Surrounding these
men with her own, each of whom had sword, spear, or
battle-axe ready in his hand, she marched them to
the forecastle and forced them, on pain of instant
death, to serve the two great cannon which were in
the bow-ports. The first discharge of these was the
explosion I had heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The balls from these pieces were so ineffective,
passing wide of the mark and splashing into the sea
a considerable distance from the galleon, that her
anger was kindled, and she warned the master of the
ordnance that if he were not more successful on a
second attempt she would not spare him, being
assured that he was merely trifling with her.</p>

<p>Whether it was because of the terrifying effect
of her words, or because he was determined to give
the galleon every opportunity for getting away from
us, and was reckless of what became of himself, the
succeeding shots flew as wide as before. When
Grace O’Malley perceived this she was transported
with rage, and, crying that he had brought his
fate upon his own head, ran him through with her
sword.</p>

<p>Had she not quickly interfered, all his companions
would have been instantly despatched by
the Irish, who were eager to emulate the example
she had set them.</p>

<p>Aghast at the death of the master of the ordnance,
and suspecting that there was no hope of
anything else for themselves, they cried out sharply,
breathlessly, tremblingly, each protesting and vowing
by all the saints that he would undertake to do
whatever he was bid, if only his life were promised
him.</p>

<p>Seeing from their look that they were likely to
do as they said, but fearing lest they should be unstrung,
being so wrought upon by their terror, she
agreed that they should not be slain, but commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
them to chose from out of their number him who
was the most skilful cannoneer, so that there should
be no mistake in regard to the fit service of the
ordnance. At the same time she told them that all
their lives depended on him, for if he failed at the
next discharge to damage the galleon, not only would
he be immediately killed, but that all of them would
likewise suffer instant death.</p>

<p>They chattered for a second together, and then
one of them, perhaps bolder or more desperate than
the rest, stepped forward, and accepted her offer.</p>

<p>Having warned him again, Grace O’Malley had
the guns loaded once more, and stood over the man
with drawn sword as he applied the burning match
to the touch-hole of first one cannon and then of
the other. When the smoke had cleared away, it
was seen that the mainmast of the galleon had
been shot through and had fallen over, so that it
lay partly across her waist and partly was in the
water.</p>

<p>Thus impeded, the galleon almost at once lost
her sea-way, and both the <i>Santa Ana</i> and the
<i>Capitana</i> began rapidly to come up with her.
Meanwhile shouts and shrieks resounded from her
decks; her sailors ran about in fear and confusion,
but after awhile they appeared to be got into some
kind of order, and, as a ball from her boomed across
our bows, it was evident that her captain was resolved
to fight for his ship.</p>

<p>As our vessels approached, we received a broadside
from her which did us both no little harm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
especially to our hulls and rigging, and a shot tore
along the forecastle of the <i>Capitana</i> in an oblique
direction, killing two of my crew and wounding three
or four men before it plunged into the sea.</p>

<p>But it was impossible for her to prevent us from
coming up alongside of her, and so soon as we had
made ourselves fast to her our boarders poured in
upon her. And thereupon ensued a battle not more
terrible than obstinate, while the faint streaks of a
cold and troubled dawn stole upon us, shedding its
gleams on the dead and dying as they lay in pools of
blood upon her decks.</p>

<p>No quarter was asked or given. Whom the sword
or the battle-axe or the spear smote not, him the sea
received, for many of the Spaniards, crying that all
was lost, threw themselves from the galleon into the
water and were drowned. There remained, however,
towards the end of the fight a small company of
arquebusiers and swordsmen upon the poop, and
among them was the captain of the ship, his clothing
stained and disordered, and a great, red sword in his
hand.</p>

<p>Seeing that no hope remained, he made signs
that he wished to surrender, and begged that his
life and the lives of those with him might be spared,
to which Grace O’Malley straightway assented.</p>

<p>As he walked towards her with his sword in his
hand, with the purpose apparently of presenting it
to her in token of his submission, he seemed to
stumble on the planks, which were slippery with
blood, and then, suddenly recovering himself, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
made a mad, swift rush forward, and would have
wounded, perhaps killed, my mistress if his intention
had not been guessed by Tibbot, who in the very nick
of time dashed aside the point of the captain’s sword
and brained him with his battle-axe.</p>

<p>So incensed were the Irish at this act of treachery
that they would show no mercy, and not a soul was
left alive.</p>

<p>Thus was the <i>San Miguel</i>, as she proved herself
to be, taken.</p>

<p>Our first care now was to return to Inisheer,
so the three galleons were trimmed as well as was
within our power, and our course was shaped for the
island, where our three galleys lay, and which was
reached in due time without our seeing any more
ships of the wine fleet.</p>

<p>And here we remained, among the islands of
Arran, for several days, waiting for the other two
galleons of which we had heard; but as they did not
come into sight, we conjectured that they had either
put into some port in another part of Ireland or had
been driven on the rocks and wrecked.</p>

<p>Then we bore northwards with the Spanish
galleons and our three galleys to a sequestered bay
on the coast of Iar-Connaught, where we concealed
in caves and other secret places well known to us
a portion of the great treasure and of the rich stores
that had been found in the merchant ships. Some
of their ordnance was put on board the galleys and
the rest cast into the sea.</p>

<p>As for the galleons themselves, they were steered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
within a mile of the harbour of Galway, in full view
of its walls, set on fire, and then sent adrift, blazing, in
the bay; while the prisoners, all save Don de Vilela
and Fitzgerald, were landed on the coast, and left
to make the best of their way to the city, where
on their arrival they published abroad all that Grace
O’Malley had done.</p>

<p>And I have not wit enough to describe the
amazement and anger of Sir Nicholas, nor the
disappointment and vexation of the merchants at
the losses they had sustained through the destruction
of the wine fleet.</p>

<p>But homeward to Clew Bay we sailed, and little
cared we.</p>

<small>“REDSHANK AND REBEL.”</small></h2>


<p>Before we had left the Bay of Galway for the north
I had been so constantly occupied with the unlading
of the galleons, the disposal of our plunder, and the
care and the landing of the prisoners, that I had
got no more than glimpses of my mistresses, and
then they were seldom alone. For de Vilela and
Fitzgerald, although they had a cabin given them
on <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, were but rarely on my galley
during the hours of day, spending most of the time
with the two ladies on <i>The Grey Wolf</i>.</p>

<p>I perceived they were treated rather as honoured
guests than as captives, and I knew that Grace
O’Malley held many long and earnest conversations
with Don Francisco, the subject of which was ever
the same&mdash;to wit, what Philip of Spain would do
on behalf of the Irish if they rose in rebellion against
the Queen.</p>

<p>Now, it mattered not at all to me who was King
or Queen of Ireland, whether it was Philip or Elizabeth
who should be sovereign of the island, and I
had as lief it were the one as the other.</p>

<p>I owed no fealty to England or to Spain, and,
being a Macdonald of the Isles, no more to the
Queen, King, or Regent of Scotland than could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
forced from us Macdonalds of the West, and that
was never overmuch. But I was sworn to the
service of Grace O’Malley, and if she preferred Spain
to England, then it was Spain for me! Yet what
I had heard of Philip made me conclude that the
Irish would not find him to their liking, as certainly
he was not to mine.</p>

<p>For, as a thing of course, there arose this
question: If Philip helped the Irish to drive the
English out of Ireland, and the English were expelled
from the island, what reward would Philip expect
to receive in return? Would he not look to become
its king? However, so far as I was concerned, the
answer lay with my mistress and not with me.</p>

<p>What struck deeper to my heart, so that it was
filled with aching every hour, was no such great
affair as the possession of a kingdom; yet was it
greater to me than all the kingdoms of the world.
It was that I began to doubt&mdash;nay, to fear&mdash;that the
dear, sweet, fair woman whom I loved would never
be mine.</p>

<p>I had dreamed that I, too, would be a king&mdash;her
king. Now I saw, or seemed to see, myself
uncrowned, disrobed, and beggared, thrust outside
the gates of the palace in which she dwelt. But
I had never been crowned, nor robed, nor rich, save
in visions, and was in truth the veriest beggar on
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Although I was able to be so little with my
mistresses, I was not so blind as not to see that
de Vilela was entirely fascinated by Eva O’Malley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
She had impressed him from the first, and herein
I blamed him not. And the more he saw of her
the more her charm worked upon him. That surprised
me not; it would have been surprising if it
had not.</p>

<p>What stung me to the soul was that Eva was
evidently interested in the man, listening absorbedly
to everything he said. Many strange and curious
tales had he to tell of Spain and of the Moors, and,
most of all, of those new lands beyond the seas,
inhabited by the Indians, with their magical cities
of gold and their wondrous mines of gems and
precious stones. Spoke he, too, of the mysteries of
those far-off regions; of the lakes and forests and
mountains that floated above the clouds, swimming
in the silent air; of sacred temples rising tower above
tower, exceeding majestical, out of wide plains of
gleaming verdure; of their princes and priests and
people&mdash;all themes as entrancing as any story of
chivalry.</p>

<p>Nor lacked he such also, for he could tell of those
splendid feats of arms which have made the glory
of the world. He was a master, too, of the secrets
of courts, and stood high in the councils of his King.</p>

<p>’Twas no wonder that that soft tongue of his
wooed and won upon our women, who had so often
heard with delight the ruder stories of our bards.
Who was I to match myself against this paragon, this
paladin, this gentle and perfect knight?</p>

<p>My thoughts were bitter and gloomy, like one
walking in the shadow of death, and I had not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the poor consolation of saying to myself that Don
Francisco was nothing more than a squire of dames&mdash;at
home rather in my lady’s bower than in the
tented field&mdash;for there was that about him which
proclaimed him a soldier, and even a veteran of war.
Good reason, too, had we to know him before many
weeks were past for the bold and ready sword he
was.</p>

<p>And when we had returned to Clew Bay, and the
galleys were safe in the haven under Knockmore,
both de Vilela and Fitzgerald accompanied us to
the castle of Carrickahooley, where they were received
by my mistresses as if they held them in
their kindest regard. Indeed, they were so courteously
entertained that the darkness of my spirits
deepened, so that I hardly knew myself.</p>

<p>I was in as many moods as there were hours in
the day, until I felt a shame of myself and of my
weakness born in me. At first, I had chafed and
fretted like a spoiled child; then a sullen and savage
temper had possessed me, so that I could see that
the crews of the galleys observed me, thinking that
perhaps the bite of my wounds still hurt and galled;
now, recovering myself, I bade myself endure hardness,
and bear the lash of the whip of fate, and be
a man.</p>

<p>But my dear was very dear to me, and my heart
rebelled.</p>

<p>In the meantime I was going backward and forward
among the islands and on the mainland, distributing
portions of the plunder we had taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the galleons to the widows and relatives of those
who had fallen in the fighting, as was the custom
of Grace O’Malley with her people. Other parts of
the spoil were for greater security put into the
strong chambers under the castle and elsewhere.</p>

<p>There remained the chest of gold and various
vessels and chains and rings of silver and gold,
many of them richly jewelled, to be hidden away,
and, for this purpose, Grace O’Malley and I went in
a boat by ourselves to the Caves of Silence under
the Hill of Sorrow. And as I rowed, and considered
the while what significance there was in the gold
not being restored to those who made claim to being
its owners, I experienced a sudden lightening of my
spirits.</p>

<p>I reasoned that there must be some doubt in
the mind of my mistress of the truth of the story
she had been told of the chest of gold, or else she
would not have kept it. She could not entirely
trust them&mdash;de Vilela and Fitzgerald&mdash;or she would
have returned the money to them. So I thought,
but even this comfort was taken from me.</p>

<p>When we had reached the dark, narrow strait
that lies between the high cliffs, the grim sentinels
which guard the entrance to the caves, the boat
shot into it like an arrow, and, without a word, we
went swiftly for a distance of half a mile or more&mdash;the
zip-drip of the oars alone being heard, eerie and
startling, as the sound shivered up the black walls
of rock.</p>

<p>There, jutting out from them, was the Red Crag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that is in shape like the head of a bull even to the
horns; beyond, a strip of beach, and, at the side of
it, a ledge of grey-blue stone; then again the rock
walls, ever narrowing and becoming yet more narrow,
until they closed in an archway, and we lost the
light of day as the boat passed on up the fissure
that runs deep into the bowels of the Hill of Sorrow.
There was not room for rowing, and I forced the boat
along with a hook, Grace O’Malley having lighted
a torch.</p>

<p>Then we came to the black, slippery block of
stone which seems to close up the passage, but the
secret of which was known to us, and to us only.</p>

<p>Here we entered&mdash;by what way I may never tell&mdash;and
were in the first cave of silence, a vast, gloomy,
ghostly, dimly-lit hall, with tables and altars and
seats carved out of the living rock by hands dead
these many thousand years, and on the floor where
it was stone and not water, a grey, powdered dust,
faintly coloured here and there as with specks of
rust&mdash;and all that dust was once alive, for these caves
are the graves of men.</p>

<p>Out of this vast chamber opened a number of
smaller caves, that looked not unlike the cells of
monks&mdash;and monks of some sort perhaps were they
who lived and died here. And everywhere silence&mdash;a
chill, brooding, fearful, awful silence; and the living
rock, hewn and cut; and the floors that were partly
stone and partly water; and the grey, rust-spotted
dust of death!</p>

<p>In one of these caverns we deposited the treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
taken from the galleon, hardly speaking except in
whispers as we did so, for the hush of the place lay
on us like a spell.</p>

<p>I ever felt a creepy horror of these dim, dumb
shades, and was glad, when our work was done, to
return again to the light of the sun.</p>

<p>It was on our way back to the castle that Grace
O’Malley spoke of what was in her mind. Her face
was stern and set and full of purpose.</p>

<p>“Ruari,” said she, “much has happened since
last we visited these caves together with my father,
Owen. Now he is gone, and I, his daughter, am
proscribed by the English. To what better end
could the treasure in these caves be put than to help
to drive the English out of Ireland?”</p>

<p>“The treasure is yours,” said I slowly, for her
words killed my new-found hope, “to do with as
you list, and your will is mine. But the English are
many, and brave and strong. Remember Shane
O’Neil, and how he fell before them. It would be a
terrible thing to lose the treasure, and still to have
the English in the land.”</p>

<p>“We are at war with them in any case,” said she.
“As for Shane O’Neil, he was unsuccessful because
he stood alone, but if all the princes and chiefs of
the island unite, the result would surely be different.
Then there is the power of Spain to be thrown into
the balance on our behalf. The King has promised
to send both men and money, if we will but compose
our own feuds, and band ourselves together for the
one common object.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>I answered not a word, but pulled at the oars
doggedly.</p>

<p>“Ruari!” she exclaimed. “Why this silence?
It is not like you to be so quiet when the sound
of battle is in the air.”</p>

<p>“Say on,” cried I, “I am your servant.”</p>

<p>She gazed at me, as one who considered anxiously
a thing which puzzled her.</p>

<p>“It is not the treasure, surely?” said she. “When
did you care for anything save the taking of it?”
Then a light leaped into her eyes, and she laughed
more heartily than she had done for days. “You
do not like Don Francisco? That is it!” And she
laughed again.</p>

<p>“Don Francisco is well enough,” said I, but she
passed the empty words by.</p>

<p>“Eva is but a young lass,” said she, with the hardness
gone from her face, so tender had it become all
at once, “and the Don, who is certainly a gallant
gentleman, and not a love-sick boy, gives her
pleasure with his tales and romances. That is all!”</p>

<p>A love-sick boy! That was I, Ruari Macdonald.
So Grace O’Malley knew my secret; did Eva know
it also?</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley,” said I, resting on the oars, in
anguish, for her words brought no solace to me, “my
heart is sore.”</p>

<p>“Ruari,” said she impatiently, “you are nothing
but a big boy. Eva had a liking for de Vilela, and
so have I, but neither of us has any love for him.”</p>

<p>“She does not love him!” cried I doubtfully, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
with a gladness unspeakable conquering the doubt;
“she does not love him!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Ruari!” said my mistress, with a deep,
almost melancholy gravity. “If this noble Spaniard
love her truly, and she do not him, consider how
terrible a misfortune has befallen him. To love
greatly, nobly, truly&mdash;”and then she paused&mdash;”and
to find that such a love is unreturned&mdash;&mdash;” and again
she stopped. “But love is not for me; these Caves
of Silence give me strange thoughts,” continued she.</p>

<p>Here was my mistress in a mood that was new to
me, and I held my peace, wondering. I had deemed
that her thoughts were set on war and her quarrel
with the Governor of Galway, forgetting, as I so often
did, that she was a woman as well as our princess
and chief.</p>

<p>“Do you not understand,” said she again, “that
the English will not be satisfied to let our affairs
remain as they are? This is not like the strife
between two of our septs. Think you that Sir
Nicholas is the man to be easily defied? Not so;
the matter is no more than begun. He will try to
have his revenge, nor will he tarry long over it. See,
then, how great an advantage it is for us that de Vilela
should have come to us at such a time, with the
assistance of the King of Spain. Will not the whole
island rise against the Queen of England?”</p>

<p>“To make Philip King of Ireland?” asked I.</p>

<p>“I know not that,” replied she; “but the first
thing is to expel the English.”</p>

<p>Then she told me that Fitzgerald and de Vilela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
were soon to set out, making their way across the
country to the Earl of Clanrickarde, and, later, to
the Earl of Desmond, who was known to be disaffected
to the government. By the spring of the following
year, it was hoped a general rising would be arranged
for, and in the interval soldiers and money would
arrive from Spain, and a camp would be formed at a
point on the coast, chosen for its ease of access from
the open sea, and the readiness with which it could
be fortified.</p>

<p>It was much, nay, it was everything, for me to
know that Eva O’Malley was not in love with Don
Francisco, and it was with very changed feelings that
I returned to Carrickahooley.</p>

<p>Yet, though I had my mistress’s assurance that all
was well, I soon became doubtful and dissatisfied, for
time passed and de Vilela made no preparations to
depart on his mission to Clanrickarde, while his
devotion to Eva was more evident day by day. I
asked myself why he lingered, considering the importance
of the business on which he was engaged,
and Eva was the only reply to that question.</p>

<p>It was when I was in this unhappy frame of mind
that one of Richard Burke’s messengers, who had
come by way of Lough Corrib and Lough Mask from
Galway, arrived at the castle, bringing news that Sir
Nicholas Malby was on the point of setting out to
eat us up.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the man, who was a half-witted
creature, and so permitted to wander about at his
pleasure, no one doing him hurt because such as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
were counted outside of the course of nature, could
tell us little or nothing. Richard the Iron had
either not trusted him with more than the barest
message, or else had had no opportunity for saying
more. It was possible, also, that he had not been
able to find out exactly what was intended against us.</p>

<p>The season was still fine and open, and if the
Governor so determined it, he could attack us by
bringing a force along the shores of the lakes, and
then up by the valley of the Eriff. Or, if he designed
to assault us from the sea, as he might if he had
obtained some of Winter’s ships of war, he might
purpose to come that way at us. But Burke’s
messenger could tell us nothing of this.</p>

<p>It seemed more likely that, as the march through
Connaught would be slow and tedious, and beset by
the dangers which attend the passage of a large body
of men through a difficult and little known country,
he would strive to reach and assault us by sea.</p>

<p>Therefore, Grace O’Malley commanded me to take
<i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and, sailing southwards, to keep a
look-out for Sir Nicholas and the English vessels of
Winter, then in charge of a great part of the fleet
of Queen Elizabeth. And, indeed, I was eager to be
gone, not only because I was ever ready for action of
one kind or another, but also because I felt it would
be a relief to the painful uncertainty in which I was
with regard to Eva.</p>

<p>I had several times resolved to speak to my dear
of the love for her which burned within me, but no
fit occasion seemed to arise, and, shy and timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
where she was concerned, I had not had the wit to
make one for myself. And I marvelled at myself,
being bold, not to say foolhardy, in most matters, and
yet not a little of a coward before this one small,
fair woman.</p>

<p>Out from Clew Bay put we with all haste, the
wind and sea not being amiss, and here for two days we
drove before the breeze without coming in sight of a
ship of any size. On the third day we lay off shore
in a bay not many leagues from Galway, and there
the hours passed by, and still there was no sign of
Winter’s vessels.</p>

<p>I was in two minds, nor could at first settle with
myself whether to return to Clew Bay at once, having
come to the conclusion that Sir Nicholas was to
attack us by land, or to endeavour to enter Galway,
and so to discover what he had done, or was about
to do.</p>

<p>Now it was of the utmost consequence that we
should learn what were the plans of the Governor, if
they could be come at in any way, and, having informed
my officers of what I proposed, I determined
to disguise myself and to enter the city to obtain
what we were in search of.</p>

<p>Bidding my people return to Clew Bay if I
came not back to the galley in three days at the
furthest, I put on the dress of a mendicant friar, and
in the night was rowed to the fishing village that is
just outside the gates of Galway. Landing, I made
my way to the huts, and saw a light burning in one.
When I knocked at the door, a man appeared, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
seeing a priest, as he thought, asked my blessing and
invited me to enter.</p>

<p>After a few words, I threw myself down on the
earthen floor, and, saying that I was weary and fain
would sleep, closed my eyes and waited for the dawn.
The fisherman made some rough provision for my
comfort, and left me; but I could hear him whispering
to his wife, and her replying to something he
had said.</p>

<p>When the morning was come, I asked to be
shown the house of the nearest priest, whom I
found, early as it was, astir and busy with his
office. Discovering myself to him&mdash;and this I did
because I knew all the Irish priests were our friends&mdash;I
requested him to tell me where Sir Nicholas
was.</p>

<p>But he made answer that he went seldom within
the walls of the city, as the watch was very strict
since the escape of Grace O’Malley, and that no one
was suffered to go in or out save only by permission
of the marshal. He had heard, however, that since
her flight the Irish in Galway and the neighbourhood
were regarded with suspicion, and that some of them
had been cast into prison. Sir Nicholas, he thought,
was still in Galway.</p>

<p>As for Grace O’Malley, she had been proclaimed
a traitress by the Governor, and an enemy of the
Queen. I myself, Ruari Macdonald, was also proscribed
as an abettor of her treasons, and a great
reward was offered for the head of the “redshank
and rebel,” as Sir Nicholas was pleased to call me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>And these things did not disquiet me exceedingly,
but what did was, that I could learn nothing of
Richard Burke, whom I desired above all to see.
Him, then, had I first to seek out, and, so soon as
the gates were open, I set out for Galway, trusting
that my priest’s dress would satisfy the watch, and
that I should be allowed to enter without any trouble
or disturbance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>THE WHISPERING ROCKS.</small></h2>


<p>The air was cool and the light clear as I stepped
briskly along from the village in a northerly direction,
up over the high, wooded lands that lie on that side
of Galway. From an open space I obtained a view
of the town and its harbour, and was well pleased
to note that no ship of war, or large vessel of any
kind, rode at anchor in the bay. Plainly, the English
admiral, Winter, had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>Then I struck across to the east, and so fetched
a compass round until I came upon the road that
leads to the great gate of the city, and there, no
distance off, was the gate, open. Two carts, going to
market with provisions, were passing in, and their
drivers were stopped by the watch and interrogated.</p>

<p>Now, I had no overweening confidence in the
completeness of my disguise, and it was evident that
what the village priest had told me was true as to
the care exercised in the admission of anyone within
the walls, so I drew off and tarried awhile, to see
if chance would not put some opportunity into my
hands.</p>

<p>I reflected, too, with perturbation, that I had no
weapon with me except a dagger&mdash;the robe I was
wearing making it impossible to conceal a sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
beneath it. But then, again, came the thought that,
however well I might have been armed, I was but
one man with one life, and that I was about to
adventure it in a city full of my enemies. Yet is
there that in the mere grip of the cold cross of a
sword that keeps the blood a flowing fire in one’s
veins, and I regretted that I had had to leave my
good blade behind.</p>

<p>While I was thus communing with myself, I
saw two Franciscans approach, going towards the
gate, and I straightway resolved to join them. They
were talking loudly, as if there were a bone of contention
between them, and, when they observed me,
they both, in one breath, as it were, addressed me,
each one asking me to give a decision in his favour
on the subject they differed about, which was&mdash;Whether
St. Patrick were an Irishman or not?</p>

<p>I answered craftily that I should like to hear
the arguments on both sides of the question, and
requested them to choose which of them should be
the first speaker. Whereupon, they halted in the
road, disputing which should have the preference,
and were like to have spent the morning before
they had settled this, as neither would yield to the
other, if I had not made a movement towards the gate.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, turning to one of them&mdash;they had
now ranged themselves on either side of me as we
walked on&mdash;”what say you? That the holy Patrick
was&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I say he was an Irishman,” burst in the other,
on my left, before I had finished the sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>“An Irishman!” exclaimed the Franciscan on
my right, “an Irishman! Not he. He was a
Scot!”</p>

<p>“I say he was an Irishman!”</p>

<p>“And I maintain he was a Scot!”</p>

<p>“An Irishman!”</p>

<p>“A Scot!”</p>

<p>Their voices rose into shoutings and roarings, as
they glared across me with angry eyes.</p>

<p>“St. Patrick was never born in Ireland,” cried
the one.</p>

<p>“St. Patrick was never born anywhere else,”
retorted the other.</p>

<p>“I tell you, by the Mass, that St. Patrick was a
Scot.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, by St. Peter, he was not.”</p>

<p>And thus they wrangled until we had reached
the gate, where I perceived the noise they made
had already attracted the notice of the watch.
Without appearing to pay any attention to the
soldiers, I nodded now to the Franciscan on my
right, and now to him on my left, as if I followed
their words intently.</p>

<p>All my senses, however, were on the stretch, and
my heart throbbed and fluttered in my breast, for
the danger was great.</p>

<p>“’Tis Father Ambrose and Father Gregory,” I
heard one of the soldiers say, “and another of the
fathers.” Then he glanced at me inquiringly, but
only asked, “To the Church of St. Nicholas, fathers?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, and we were passing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
when an officer of the Governor’s came down the
street, and, scowling at us, bade us halt.</p>

<p>“Whither go ye?” he demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>“To the Church of St. Nicholas,” said we as with
one voice, for I had made up my mind to go thither
also.</p>

<p>“There be too many priests in Galway already,”
said he, with stern-knit brows, “and, had I my way,
I should hang ye all. Know ye these men?” he
called to the watch.</p>

<p>I held my breath. Father Ambrose and Father
Gregory they appeared to know, but as to myself,
what would they say?</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the soldier who had spoken before,
and as soon as I heard this, I moved on, the Franciscans
accompanying me, and beginning their dispute
over again.</p>

<p>And so on we walked to the Church of St.
Nicholas, while I could scarcely credit having thus
fortunately made my entrance into Galway. Having
arrived at the church, I directed my steps to the
shrine of my patron saint, where, on my knees, with
more than the devoutness of many a monk, I offered
him my gratitude for his favour and protection, and
implored a continuance of the same.</p>

<p>Thus engaged, I had not at once observed that
someone had come up behind me, and was kneeling
two or three paces away. When I looked up I saw
the figure of a woman, but her face I could not see
for the shadow of a pillar that intervened.</p>

<p>Somehow, the form seemed familiar, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
she rose up from praying and turned to go, I was
startled to find myself gazing at Sabina Lynch. She
glanced at me curiously, but, beholding only a friar,
passed on sedately out of the building, little thinking
at the moment that she had ever been carried, and
that not too gently nor so long ago, in that friar’s arms.</p>

<p>To keep up the character I had assumed I
began begging, according to the manner of the
order of mendicants, from door to door, so soon
as I had quitted the church, hoping in this way to
light upon someone from whom I might safely
ask if Richard Burke were lodging in the town.</p>

<p>And in this it appeared altogether probable
that I should have no success, for in many instances
I was driven from the doors of the people without
ceremony, or paid no heed to whatever. Indeed,
the whole town seemed to be agog with something,
and, as the streets were now filled with soldiers
marching in companies, it was easy to be seen
that there was good reason for the excitement.</p>

<p>When I inquired of a man who had given me
an alms, and who was of a friendly disposition,
what was the cause of all this moil and stir, he
replied that surely I must be a stranger not to
know that Sir Nicholas was bringing an army
together in the town with which he meant to
punish the rebels of Connaught.</p>

<p>“What rebels?” asked I innocently.</p>

<p>“That pestilent and notable woman,” said he,
“Grace O’Malley, and all her tribe of robbers and
murderers and pirates.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told me how she had destroyed the
wine fleet of Galway, and so had come near to
ruining the trade of the port.</p>

<p>“She is a devil,” quoth he, and he crossed
himself, “and the Governor will kill her and her
people.”</p>

<p>“A woman!” cried I, with a great show of
being astonished beyond measure.</p>

<p>“Ay, a woman,” said he, “but she must be a
devil.” And he crossed himself again. Then he
added: “If she be not the very devil in the shape
of a woman, there is with her a man, a giant&mdash;a
great, strong giant&mdash;whom she calls her brother,
but who is said to have come out of the sea, and
is no man at all, but a devil too. Some say he
is a Redshank of the Scots, but I tell you he is a
devil too.”</p>

<p>And thus the fellow maundered on, while I
found some trouble in restraining myself from bursting
into laughter in his face. Having, however,
thanked him civilly for his alms and information,
I gave him my blessing&mdash;a devil’s blessing&mdash;and
so left him.</p>

<p>We were devils!</p>

<p>What, then, were those who thought nothing of
breaking a safe-conduct, or of poisoning the wine
at banquets to which they had invited their victims
as loving guests? Yet the first had happened in
the case of my mistress, and the second had been
the fate of many an Irish chief.</p>

<p>We were devils, and so to be feared! It was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
such bad thing at that time and in that land to
be counted as devils, for men who had no fear of
God before their eyes, nor of his saints, were afraid
of devils.</p>

<p>I had now come to the tavern that is under
the sign of the Golden Eagle, and from inside
proceeded the sound of eating and of drinking, of
festivity and of mirth. Entering in, I was about
to beg for alms, when I saw among the company
a man whom I recognised as one of the Mayo
Burkes, a gallowglass of the MacWilliam’s. Him I
at once addressed, incautiously enough, asking if
his master were well, and where I would find him,
as I had a message for his private ear.</p>

<p>“Richard the Iron,” said he, “is lodged in the
North Street; and who are you, father, that know
not that?”</p>

<p>“I have been there,” said I, lying boldly, “but
he is away from the house.”</p>

<p>“If he be not at the mansion of the Joyces,”
said he, “then I know not where he is.”</p>

<p>So Richard Burke was at the mansion of the
Joyces in the North Street. Here was good news
indeed, and, having said some fair words to the
man, I went out of the tavern; but when I reached
the North Street I found that my falsehood had
this much of truth in it&mdash;that Richard Burke was
not there. I sat down on a bench in the courtyard
of the mansion, and waited impatiently for
his return. Tiring of this, I walked up the street
towards the Little Gate, and whom should I meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
on the way but Richard Burke riding with Sabina
Lynch.</p>

<p>Well did I recall what Richard Burke had said
to me some weeks before, when he had come secretly
to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>. He had declared that Sabina
Lynch loved him, but that he only cared for Grace
O’Malley. Yet, as I looked at them, it seemed to
me as if he were paying Mistress Lynch no little
court, and they appeared to take pleasure in each
other’s society.</p>

<p>But when I thought of the messenger he had
sent to Carrickahooley, and of his service, though
unavailing, to us before, I conceived that he was
playing a double part, holding that love and war,
perhaps, justified any means so long as the end
were gained. And, for that matter, I, the false
friar, was no better than a cheat myself.</p>

<p>I was determined to get speech with him without
further delay&mdash;the feeling of impatience was
so strong upon me&mdash;and, as I was casting about
in what way I should accomplish this, Sabina
Lynch tossed me a piece of silver as an alms,
while I was yet three ells’ length from the
horses.</p>

<p>“Take that for the poor, father,” cried she
merrily.</p>

<p>It happened that the coin after it had struck
the ground, rolled in front of Richard Burke’s horse,
and I rushed forward to pick it up before it was
trampled into the dust. I also trusted that under
cover of this action I should be able to say a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
words which would make me known to him, without
being perceived by his companion.</p>

<p>As I stepped into the street, he was compelled
to rein in his horse, and then to pass by the side
of me.</p>

<p>“What a greedy, clumsy friar he is!” laughed
Sabina Lynch.</p>

<p>In truth, I was as clumsy as clumsy could be,
for as I drew myself up and tried to stand erect
I hit my shoulder against Richard Burke’s foot,
whereupon he stopped.</p>

<p>“Father,” said he, good-humouredly, “have you
no care for yourself? Then, prithee, have a care
for me.”</p>

<p>And he smiled; but when he had looked into
my face, and had met my eyes, I saw the blood
suddenly leave his cheeks, and knew that he had
penetrated my disguise.</p>

<p>He gave so great a start that his horse leaped
up under him, and, as it did so, the friar’s cowl,
which covered my head and partially hid my face,
was thrown back, and there stood I, Ruari Macdonald,
disclosed and discovered, before Sabina
Lynch.</p>

<p>She gazed from the one to the other of us in
silence, then, striking her horse violently, galloped
off, exclaiming: “Treason, treason!”</p>

<p>Richard Burke was in a maze.</p>

<p>“Ruari!” he gasped, and could say no more.</p>

<p>“I have come to Galway,” said I quickly, “that
I might have knowledge of the Governor’s inten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tions
against us. This is no place for us now,”
cried I, to rouse him, for he was like one that
dreamed, “come, come with me before the hue
and cry is raised.”</p>

<p>And I seized the bridle of his horse and turned
its head, and led it towards the Little Gate.</p>

<p>“Not that way,” said he wildly. “I have just
come from thence.”</p>

<p>Then he gathered himself and his wits together.</p>

<p>“The Great Gate is best. Ay, this is no place
now for me any more than it is for you. Well said
you that. We will go together; but let us not go
too swiftly, otherwise the watch, suspecting something
is wrong, will not let us pass. We have a
few minutes to spare before the gates can be closed.
Do you walk a little way behind me.”</p>

<p>I had replaced the cowl about my head, and,
hardly knowing whether to be glad or sorry at
what had fallen out, marched at a rapid pace after
him up the street of the Great Gate.</p>

<p>Richard Burke was well known to the watch, and
no objection was made to our passing out. As long
as we were within sight of the walls we went at a
walk, but when a turn of the road had hid them from
us, I grasped the saddle-cloth and ran beside the
horse, which its rider now urged along at the top
of its speed.</p>

<p>We had gone about two miles, and had gained
an eminence partly sheltered by trees, when, looking
back, we saw the figures of horsemen spurring after
us out of the city. On we sped again, until I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
run no more. Then I besought Burke to leave me
as I was spent and blown. But this he would not
hearken to at first.</p>

<p>“It will be a strange thing,” said I, “if I cannot
conceal myself somewhere in the trees and bushes,
or among the rocks, for the night. In the morning
I will make my way back to the galley.”</p>

<p>And I persuaded him to ride on towards his own
territory, but not before he had told me that Sir
Nicholas had drawn a force of a hundred men from
Athlone, everyone of whom was a trained and
hardened soldier, and with these, his own men,
and the gallowglasses of Sir Morrough O’Flaherty
of Aughnanure, who had promised to support him,
was about to set out at once for our overthrow.</p>

<p>The Governor was terribly enraged against us, and
in his anger at the destruction of the wine fleet had
sworn he would make an end of us all. His wrath
burned not only against Grace O’Malley, but against
many others of the Irish, and there had been such
a killing and a hanging of those who were thought
hostile to the government as had never before been
seen or heard of in Galway.</p>

<p>Richard Burke had only escaped because of his
friendship with the Mayor and his daughter Sabina
Lynch, but his every act was spied upon.</p>

<p>“I remained in the city for no other reason,” he
declared, “than to see if I could not afford some help
to you in one way or another.”</p>

<p>As he departed, he said, as he wrung my hand,
“I shall cast in my lot with yours, and, if it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
be done in the time left to us, I shall bring all
the Burkes of Mayo to your assistance. Should
you reach Carrickahooley first, tell your mistress
that.”</p>

<p>Then he swung himself again into the saddle,
and was gone.</p>

<p>He was hardly out of sight, when I heard the
sound of hoofs beating on the road, and creeping
in through the bushes that lined a small stream by
the wayside I laid me down to rest, and soon I was
listening to the voices of the men in pursuit of us
as they drew near. They made no pause, but swept
on past the spot where I lay.</p>

<p>I was about to emerge from my place of concealment,
when again the tramp of horses fell upon
my ear, and, looking out, I saw Sir Nicholas and
several of his officers come riding slowly along. They
stopped quite close to me, and, dismounting, made a
survey of the land all around, but, my star favouring
me, they moved to the further side of the stream.</p>

<p>“Let the camp be pitched here,” said Sir Nicholas,
“and do you remain until the men come up.”</p>

<p>I guessed that he had been told of my presence in
Galway, and had immediately ordered the soldiers to
set out to catch me so that we should have no
advantage from our being warned of his purpose.</p>

<p>My position was now one of extreme peril; I was
cut off from returning to my galley; and I could see
nothing for it but to remain where I was until the
soldiers had gone on on their journey, unless I took
the chances of the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>There I lay, and, as the night fell, the men of
Sir Nicholas marched up and lit their watch-fires
not more than a stone’s throw from where I hid.
For hours, not daring to move, I heard them singing
and talking and jesting with each other. When, at
length, silence came upon the sleeping camp, I stole
as softly as I could out of the bushes, and moving on,
like a cat, so that each step of mine was no more
noticed than a puff of wind, I managed to gain the
road that leads past Oorid and Sindilla at the foot
of the mountains. I walked fast, and sometimes
ran, until the day broke, when I turned aside, and,
having sought for and found a dry cave on the side
of a hill, fell down utterly exhausted, and ere long
was in a deep slumber.</p>

<p>I was awakened many hours later, for it was dark
again, by a strange sort of cheeping noise at my
very ears.</p>

<p>I started up, and the noise ceased; I lay down,
and the sound began once more. As I listened,
my face to the rocky floor of the cavern, I fancied
I could distinguish words, but, as it were, coming
from a great way off.</p>

<p>Now, thoroughly aroused, I listened yet more
earnestly, and I made out that there were two or
three voices, and that the sound of them was not
coming from the inside of the cave, nor yet from
the outside, but seemed to issue, like a thin whistle,
through the rock itself.</p>

<p>I moved stealthily towards the far end, and, lying
down again prone, applied my ear to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
I now heard quite distinctly, the words being audible,
though faint, and with an extraordinary effect of still
coming from an immense distance.</p>

<p>I then understood I was in one of the chambers
of the Whispering Rocks as they are called, for a
wonder of nature has so constructed them that it
is possible to hear through them, when all around
is still, whatever is said within these caverns. And
how this miracle comes to pass I know not, but
I had often heard of it; otherwise I might have
thought that these sounds came from the spirits
of the mountain, and so might not have discovered
the vile plot that had been hatched for
our ruin.</p>

<p>For, as the voices grew more and more clear, I
found myself listening to the story of how these
men who were speaking were to present themselves
at the castle of Carrickahooley in advance of the
English army, and, having gained admittance on the
plea that they were fleeing to Grace O’Malley for
protection, were treacherously to betray her and the
castle into the hands of the Governor by secretly
opening the gate as soon as the attack began.</p>

<p>I gripped my dagger in impotent rage, for, placed
as I was, I could do nothing. After a time the
voices ceased, and, moving noiselessly to the mouth
of the cave, I saw that the night was clear and
starry, and, feeling refreshed by my long repose, I
made on towards Ballanahinch, which I reached in
the morning, and where I obtained milk and the
flesh of a kid from the wife of one of the kernes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
who took me for a wandering priest, and gladly
supplied my wants.</p>

<p>For two days and the greater part of two nights
I toiled over the mountains and through the forests,
seeing no indication of the English, until I came
to the fiord of the Killery, where some of our own
people dwelt under Muilrea. From thence they
brought me round to Clew Bay in a fishing boat,
and I was back again at Carrickahooley, more dead
than alive from the fatigues I had undergone,
inured though I was to all kinds of hardness.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>A SURPRISE.</small></h2>


<p>As I stepped from the boat on to the face of the rock,
which forms a natural quay on one side of the small
harbour on the sea-front of the castle, both Grace
and Eva O’Malley, who had seen me coming across
the waters, met me and asked how I fared.</p>

<p>I was not so spent with the travail of my wearisome
journey as not to be conscious of a novel sort
of shyness on the part of my dear, who seemed
rather to hang back behind her foster-sister, and
not to be so open and outspoken with me as formerly.
With some bitterness of soul I attributed
this change of manner to her thoughts being engrossed
with de Vilela&mdash;so little was I able to read
the maid’s mind.</p>

<p>But it was no fitting time for either the softness
or the hardness of love, and my first care was to
relate all that had chanced since I had seen them
last.</p>

<p>Great was their astonishment at the way in which
Sabina Lynch came again into the tale of our fortunes,
and I could see, from a certain fierceness with
which Grace O’Malley alluded to her, that a heavy
reckoning was being laid up against her by my
mistress. Eva, however, appeared to be more struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
by the hopelessness of Sabina Lynch’s affection for
Richard Burke, and found it in her heart to pity her.</p>

<p>When I gave Richard Burke’s message to Grace
O’Malley, she rejoiced exceedingly thereat, and from
that moment&mdash;at least, so it seems to me looking
backward to those days&mdash;she began to esteem him
more highly than heretofore, and to cherish some
feeling of tenderness for him, her enmity against
Sabina Lynch, though she would not acknowledge
that there could be any rivalry between them, helping,
perhaps, thereto not a little.</p>

<p>And it appeared to me as a thing curious in itself,
and not readily explained, except by saying that my
mistress was not free from weakness, that she should
have shown a compassion, as she had done when she
had spoken to me some time before of de Vilela, for
the hapless love of a man, and had nothing of the
kind for Sabina Lynch.</p>

<p>Whatever were her thoughts on these matters,
what she said afforded no indication of them, for,
so soon as she had heard that the MacWilliam purposed
to bring over from the country of the Lower
Burkes, as they were called, to distinguish them from
the Burkes of Clanrickarde, his gallowglasses to her
aid against the English, she at once proceeded to
count up how many swords and spears were at his
command. Moreover, she regarded, she said, his
rising against the Governor as a splendid and sure
sign of what would shortly take place over the
whole of Ireland.</p>

<p>Continuing the tale of my adventures, I related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the conversation I had overheard in the case of the
mysterious Whispering Rocks, and my mistress
ordered that when the men, whose council of
treachery I had become acquainted with in so
strange a way, made their appearance, they should
forthwith be admitted into the castle, as if we had
had no knowledge of their intended perfidy, and that
they should not be dealt with as traitors until she
deemed that time was ripe for it.</p>

<p>And now, having been thus forewarned of what
was in store for her on the part of Sir Nicholas,
Grace O’Malley immediately set about placing the
castle in a position of secure defence. To this end,
several pieces of the ordnance which had been taken
from the captured galleons of the wine fleet, and
which had been put on board <i>The Grey Wolf</i> and
<i>The Winged Horse</i>, now at Clare Island, were
brought across Clew Bay, and mounted on the walls
and towers of Carrickahooley, while the gates and
the other more vulnerable parts of its fortifications
were strengthened. In all these matters we were
much assisted by Don Francisco, who had had a
large experience of sieges, and was familiar with the
onfalls and the outfalls and the other incidents of
such warfare. The Spaniard and I therefore were
together more than we had ever been before, and
towards me he carried himself like the courteous
and knightly man he was, while I strove to pattern
myself upon him.</p>

<p>That he loved Eva O’Malley I was in no doubt.
Indeed, when he assured me, as he frequently did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
how glad he was that he had not been able to leave
the castle as he had intended doing, and how well
pleased he was to have an opportunity of espousing
our quarrel with the English, I understood that it
was a delight to him to be near her in this our
time of peril, for was not that what I also told
myself continually?</p>

<p>That he bore a hatred towards England was true,
but his love for Eva, as he was to prove, was something
far greater than his hatred of the English.
Yet already, though I knew it not then, he must
have been well aware that she was not for him.
But no sign of grief or disappointment did he allow
to appear, albeit, always grave, as is the Spanish
manner, he seemed still graver before the assault
began&mdash;and this, when I observed it, I took to mean
that he considered our situation was such as called
for seriousness.</p>

<p>Whilst our preparations to repel the English
were being made, some days elapsed, and, on the
fifth of them, Calvagh O’Halloran brought <i>The Cross
of Blood</i> into port at Clare Island, where to his
great relief, not knowing what had been my fate
in Galway, he was told that I was before him at
Carrickahooley.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tidings were being brought us by
bands and families of kernes and peasants, fleeing
before the enemy, that the English were approaching.
And, as they marched northwards through
Connaught, the days were red with blood and the
nights with fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Everywhere their presence was marked by the
smoke and flame of homesteads wantonly burned,
and by the slaughter of all who fell into their hands,
neither the old nor the decrepit, nor the nursing
mother, nor the tender maiden, nor the sucking
child being left alive!</p>

<p>Among the despairing wretches who flocked to
the castle for protection it was impossible to single
out the plotters, whose knavery they had themselves
unwittingly disclosed in the Whispering Rocks, for
everyone apparently was in the same evil case. A
close watch, however, was kept on all the men
who came in, and who were retained within the
walls to help in the defence, while the women and
children were conveyed to Clare Island, where they
would be in safety.</p>

<p>Don Francisco dropped a half hint that Eva
might better be sent to Clare Island until the
fortune of battle had declared itself, but I knew
that this would seem to her to be of the nature of
deserting us at a time of crisis, and so the proposition
was carried no further.</p>

<p>And all through the siege she moved a bright,
winsome, and always cheerful presence, generally
attended by the Wise Man, Teige O’Toole, who
constituted himself her body-servant, and who,
during this period, uttered no prophecies of evil,
but cheered and sustained us with the certainty of
victory.</p>

<p>At length, on the tenth day after my return to
Carrickahooley, our spies came in from their lairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in the forests and hills with the news that the
English army was camped two leagues away, and
that it appeared to be the intention of its leaders
to spend the night there. The spies described the
army as an immense host, there being more than
three hundred well-armed soldiers, besides a great
swarm of the gallowglasses of Sir Murrough
O’Flaherty of Aughnanure, who himself had accompanied
the Governor.</p>

<p>When I inquired eagerly if Sir Nicholas had any
ordnance, the spies averred that they had seen none.
And, whether the difficulty of dragging heavy pieces
through Connaught had been found insurmountable,
or, strong in numbers and relying on the terror inspired
by the name of the English, he had resolved
to dispense with them altogether, I knew not; but
to my mind the absence of these engines of war
more than made up for his superiority over us in
men.</p>

<p>Doubtless, his action in this respect was founded
on the confidence he entertained that we were about
to be betrayed to him by the traitors within the
castle itself, nor could he dream that the galleries
of the Whispering Rocks had given up his secrets
to me.</p>

<p>All that night the guard, of which I was in command,
stood to their arms upon the battlements;
but there was not a sound save such as ever comes
from the sleeping earth or the never-sleeping sea.
The morning dawned still and fair, and the sun
rose out of the world, tinting with a fresh bloom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
slopes of the distant hills now purpling with the
bursting heather, and changing the thin, vaporous
mist that lay over land and water below them, into
one great gleaming sheen of silver.</p>

<p>All that night, too, our spies lay concealed in
the woods, and noted every movement within the
English camp; and now, as the day advanced, they
came in to report that Sir Nicholas was marching
down to the seashore. By noon he had established
himself in and about the Abbey of Burrishoole, no
regard being had to the sacredness of the building.
And here he halted for the rest of the day, probably
being greatly surprised that we had not so far offered
any resistance to his approach.</p>

<p>Now this ancient religious house stands on a
rocky height looking across the small bay that is
next to that on the edge of which the castle is built,
and therefore the distance between the enemy and
ourselves was so inconsiderable that it behoved us
to be constantly on the alert.</p>

<p>In the evening, then, when the night-watch was
posted on the walls and about the gate, I doubled
the number of the guard, choosing such men, and
those chiefly from my own crew of <i>The Cross of
Blood</i>, as were of proved endurance and courage.</p>

<p>De Vilela had proffered his services, as my second
in command, and I had given him charge of a picked
company whose station was beside the gate of the
drawbridge&mdash;that is, the gate on the landward side of
Carrickahooley.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley herself saw that everything was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
disposed according to her mind before she withdrew
to the apartments of the women in the main tower.
But well did I know that it was not to sleep that
she had gone. She had now attired herself in
the mantle, leather-quilted jack, and armour of an
Irish gentleman, and her eyes were full of the fierce
light of battle; but, deeming it likely to increase
the confidence of her people if they saw her retire
according to her usual custom, she had left us
to ourselves.</p>

<p>I was leaning upon the edge of the parapet, gazing
into the deepening darkness of the night, and musing
on many things, when one of my officers came up,
and informed me that among those who had fled to
us for refuge from the English were certain kernes
who passionately begged to be permitted to share
the night-watch, being consumed with zeal against
the enemy.</p>

<p>Knowing the treachery that was contemplated,
Grace O’Malley had had all the refugees confined
during the previous night within the buildings of
the castle, and not suffered to go abroad except in the
daytime, and now when I heard the request I felt
a certainty that the men who made it could be no
other than those whose voices I had overheard,
and who were the traitors in the pay of the
Governor.</p>

<p>As it was above all things necessary they should
have no suspicion that we had any knowledge of
their purpose, I gave my officer an answer in an
offhand manner, saying I would see these kernes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a little while, and, if I found them likely to make
good soldiers, might add them to the guard.</p>

<p>Debating with myself whether I should at once
go and tell my mistress what I thought, and also, if
I was correct in my surmise, what was the best way
in which to proceed, so that the discomfiture of these
men might be complete, the night grew apace, and
still I had come to no decision.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a slight, scarcely-seen motion&mdash;so
slight, so scarcely-seen that it might have been
caused by the vagrant breath of a passing breeze,
only there was a perfect calm&mdash;seemed to the keenness
of my sea-trained vision to make itself felt by
a sort of tremulousness in that breadth of shadow
that lay opposite me under the cold gleam of the
stars, which I knew to be the side of the hill on
which was the abbey.</p>

<p>Sounds, too, there came, but so faintly that I
could not disentangle them from the ordinary voices
of the night. Then, as I strained my eyes and ears,
both sound and motion faded away as in a dream.
I waited and watched for some minutes, but all was
as silent as death.</p>

<p>Thinking I might have been mistaken, I went
down from the battlements, and calling to the officer
who had spoken of the wish of the refugee kernes,
I bade him bring them to me in a chamber that
served as a guard-room.</p>

<p>As I entered, a solitary wolf-call came howling
through the air, and then, as the kernes came in,
there was a second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The first wolf-call had startled me, for surely, with
such a host near us, it was a strange thing for a wolf
to be thus close at hand; but when I heard the
second one there was no doubt left in my mind.
These calls were no other than the calls of human
wolves signalling each other.</p>

<p>So, bidding the men to be kept in the guard-room
till I returned, I went to the gate, and told
de Vilela that I conjectured the enemy was stealing
upon us in the darkness to take us by surprise,
expecting that their allies within our walls would
have so contrived as to make the way easy for them,
and I said I thought I could now put my hand on
these very men.</p>

<p>When I saw the kernes again, they affirmed that
they were three men of the O’Flahertys of Ballanahinch,
between whom and the O’Malleys there was
a friendship of long-standing. Now, between these
O’Flahertys and the O’Flahertys of Aughnanure there
was a desperate family feud, and their tale was not
lacking in plausibleness. They appeared to be very
eager to be employed against the enemy, and implored
to be sent to help to guard the gate, which
was the weakest part of our defences.</p>

<p>I replied that it was for me, and not for them,
to say where they should be put, but that their
prayer would be granted. As for the gate being the
weakest part of our defences, how could they say
that? Whereupon they were silent. However, I had
now determined what I was to do, so I bade them
begone to the company of de Vilela, who had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
difficulty in understanding that they were the knaves
of whom I had spoken to him.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards I saw the Spaniard, and
communicated to him my plan, which was that he
was to appear to give the kernes every opportunity
of carrying out their designs, but, without seeming
to do so, was not to lose sight of them for one
moment, and that thus he would probably be in a
position to defeat their intent.</p>

<p>To speak the truth, I did not see how I could
act in any other manner, yet I was very uneasy, and,
as the event showed, not without reason.</p>

<p>For I had been no more than back again at my
place in the black corner of the parapet, when I
heard a loud shouting at that angle of the wall
next the sea, and the sound of blows. Running
thither, I saw the dark forms of men climbing from
ladders to the top of the wall, and the pale glitter
of steel striking steel.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole castle rang with the cries
of the alarmed guard, as they hurried from all sides
to the point of attack, and torches blazed out from
the tower. The glare from these lights fell weirdly
on the forms of our people as they pressed on to
mount the parapet, yelling with lusty throats the
war-cry of the O’Malleys. I stopped and looked
down on them, and as the dancing torches flew their
flags of red and orange flame, now this way, now
that, I noticed among the crowd the faces of two of
the kernes whom I had sent to de Vilela.</p>

<p>To make certain I looked again. There assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
they were, pushing on, and pointing to the place of
assault, and shouting more loudly even than their
neighbours. I asked myself why they had left the
guard at the gate, and at once concluded that they
must have slipped away in the confusion, for
de Vilela was not likely to have given them
permission.</p>

<p>What was their object?</p>

<p>And where was the third man? I could only
see two.</p>

<p>There they were&mdash;the two whom I now plainly
discovered stepping forward, apparently as keen for
the fight as any of ourselves, making straight for the
parapet, and <i>helping to draw others along with them
away from the gate of the drawbridge</i>.</p>

<p>Was that it?</p>

<p>This thought came like the quick flashing of an
inward light, and then was succeeded by another.</p>

<p>If this were so, then it followed that the attack
we were engaged in repelling was a mere feint meant
to deceive us, and that the real assault would be
made&mdash;probably at the gate&mdash;while our attention was
held elsewhere. In any case there were sufficient, as
I conceived, of our gallowglasses now upon the walls
to beat back the enemy, and I hastened toward the
gate.</p>

<p>As I moved forward I was met by de Vilela and
most of his company, and when I stopped and asked
him why he had quitted his post, he replied that it
was in obedience to a request from me which he had
just received. Now, I had sent no such request, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the fear which had sprung up within me was at once
confirmed, as it was evident that he had been duped
by a false message, the result being that the gate
was left nearly unprotected.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” I said, at the same time telling
him quickly how the matter stood, and of the dread
that possessed me. Such of our men as I encountered
on the way I also bade turn about and follow
me. Nor were we a moment too soon.</p>

<p>Drawing nearer, we could hear the rattle and
the clank of the heavy chains of the drawbridge as
it was being lowered, and the creaking of the
ponderous gate as it swung inwards on its heavy
hinges. The flames of torches blazing from the wide
doorway of the main tower flashed upon the steel
jacks and the gauntlets of English soldiers, dim-flitting
in the half-gloom of the opening mouth of
the gate.</p>

<p>The traitor had done his work and had done it
well; yet it passes me, even to this day, to understand
how he had been able to accomplish his end thus
so swiftly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley!” I cried in a great voice
that rang out far above all the din and disorder of
the night, so that it reached the ear of my princess,
who now came hurrying on along with some of the
gentlemen of her household and a body of swordsmen.</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley!”</p>

<p>Behind me the pure deep tones of my mistress’s
cry mingled with the hoarse, harsh accents of her
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley!”</p>

<p>Fierce and terrible beyond all power of words
to express was the hardly human cry.</p>

<p>With a couple of bounds I had reached our foes.
The glimmer of a sword passed by me, and I parried
the point of a spear thrust at my breast. Then I felt
my knees gripped, and I tripped over upon the body
of the man who held me. As I stumbled, my weapon
falling from my hand, I caught a glimpse of de Vilela
standing over me, his long sword playing like lightning,
holding the enemy in check.</p>

<p>There was a rush of feet, and across me and the
man beneath me, as across a wall, did the battle rage.</p>

<p>I had fallen with my whole weight upon the man
who had seized my legs, and I heard him gasp and
sob and try for breath as he lay underneath.</p>

<p>As I felt along his form for his throat, I noticed
that he wore no armour, and my fingers became as
steel when I realised that this was no other, could be
no other, than the traitor who had opened the gate.
Whoever or whatever he was, his secret died with
him there, for I did not relax my grasp upon his
neck until I was well assured that I had twisted
and broken it.</p>

<p>And when in the morning we found the body
amongst a heap of slain, it was trampled out of
all semblance of human shape, but not so as not
to show the sign of the broken neck.</p>

<p>How I managed to roll myself out of that press
and coil I cannot tell, but yet somehow I did it,
and all the while I was strangely conscious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
de Vilela’s sword watched and warded over me, so
that I escaped with my life. This affair of mine took
not so long in the doing as in the telling of it, and
when I had struggled to my feet he was in front
of me&mdash;”Santiago! Santiago!” on his lips, as that
long sword of his sang its songs of death. Plucking
my battle-axe from my girdle I stepped to his side.</p>

<p>And now about us were my mistress and her fiery
swordsmen, mad with rage and thirsting for blood.
With wild screams we fell upon and fought back the
Englishmen, who stubbornly contested every foot
of ground, until we hurled them broken across the
bridge, pursuing them for some distance beyond the
castle. Then, facing round, we attacked from the
rear those who had attempted to enter by scaling
the walls; and perhaps some escaped in the darkness,
but of those who were seen by us not one was spared.</p>

<p>So, favourably for us, our first fight with the
English came to a close.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE GATE OF FEARS.</small></h2>


<p>During what of the night remained we continued
under arms, expecting that the attack might be
renewed, but the morning&mdash;another sunny splendour&mdash;came,
and we were undisturbed. We were now in
a better position to estimate what had occurred, and
the peril from which we had so narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>The number of our dead and wounded was not
great, but among the latter was Fitzgerald, who had
been by the side of Grace O’Malley in the fight for
the gate. Eva O’Malley, along with Teige O’Toole,
the Wise Man, who was also a mediciner, and skilled
in the use of herbs and simples, ministered to the
wants and relieved the pangs of the sufferers, as far as
lay within her power.</p>

<p>And as she passed in and out among them, her
passing seemed to me, and to others I doubt not, as
the passing of an angel. My mistress and de Vilela
were unhurt, and I had nothing more than some
bruises to show for my share in the battle.</p>

<p>Neither among the killed nor the wounded could
the two traitorous kernes be seen, and I feared that
they had contrived to make good their flight, a
thing which did not appear improbable considering
the darkness and confusion of an assault by night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
However, I had every portion of the castle searched
and scrutinised with the utmost care, and finally the
knaves were found hiding in a storeroom, which held
a large quantity of loose corn, and there, amongst the
grain, they were discovered nearly suffocated.</p>

<p>They had deserved no mercy and they were shown
none. Desirous of knowing who they in reality were,
and of obtaining any information they possessed of
the purposes of the Governor, I ordered that they
should be taken into one of the underground
dungeons, and put to the question.</p>

<p>But they were stout of heart, being, as I think, no
common men, so that torture even failed to worry
their secrets from them. When Grace O’Malley
heard that they could be forced to disclose nothing,
she directed that they should be taken and hanged
from a great gallows-beam, that sprang out from the
summit of the tower, and which could be plainly
descried by the English from Burrishoole.</p>

<p>No sooner had the fight for the gate come to an
end, than I became greatly disturbed in my mind as
to the debt I felt myself to be owing to de Vilela, for,
had it not been for that marvellous sword-play of his
I had never come out of the fray alive.</p>

<p>That was the kind of debt in payment of which a
man might almost give his all, even life itself. In
what way was I to discharge it? I consoled myself
with the thought that the chances of warfare might
provide me with the opportunity, but if not&mdash;what
then?</p>

<p>The matter lay heavy upon me, and that Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Francisco was my rival for Eva’s love, and, as I was
more than half disposed to imagine, my successful
rival did not make the burden of it the lighter to
bear. But one thing I could do, and that, the
business of the perfidious knaves being despatched,
I did. I sought him out, and, offering him my hand,
thanked him with such words as flowed from a full, if
troubled breast, for the great service he had done me.</p>

<p>“Señor,” said I impulsively, “I believe that I am
indebted to you for the greatest service one man can
render another.”</p>

<p>His attitude was that of protest, nay, of entreaty,
that I should say no more.</p>

<p>Now I have written to little purpose if I have not
made it evident that de Vilela was my superior in
every way save with respect to my strength of body,
which was the one special gift God had given me. I
had acknowledged the fact to myself, although, being
human, not perhaps ungrudgingly. As I looked into
his face, whatever poor, paltry feeling I had nourished
against him was swept away by a wave of strong
emotion.</p>

<p>“Yes, señor,” said I, “how am I to thank you?
But for you&mdash;I would have perished. What am I to
say? What can I do?”</p>

<p>“Señor Ruari,” cried he, in that soft, quiet way
of his, “between soldiers, brothers-in-arms, there is
no debt.”</p>

<p>“Señor,” said I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be generous, Señor Ruari,” exclaimed he, “and
say not a word more,” and he smiled somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
wistfully and sadly. “We are friends, at any rate,
whate’er befall, are we not?”</p>

<p>“By God’s wounds!” swore I.</p>

<p>And we clasped hands again, and so parted.</p>

<p>The day which followed that night of stir was one
of quiet at the castle, and its very peacefulness seemed
to me well-nigh intolerable. But we learned from
our spies, and could to some extent see for ourselves,
that there was a great commotion in the English
camp, indicating the arrival of fresh troops.</p>

<p>By the evening, Sir Nicholas had so disposed his
forces that we were completely hemmed in on the
land side, and our spies had to be withdrawn within
the walls. The sea was still open to us, and much I
wondered that the Governor did not take this more
into his account, for so long as we could get to our
galleys and procure food by way of Clew Bay, we
could laugh at him and bid him defiance.</p>

<p>But I might have been sure that Sir Nicholas was
too experienced a soldier not to know well what he
was about.</p>

<p>Another night and another day dragged themselves
slowly away, and the Governor moved not from
the positions he had taken up. There he lay all
round us, just out of reach of our ordnance, of which
we gave him a taste from time to time, so that he
should keep his distance; there he lay, inactive,
waiting, expectant&mdash;but of what, or, of whom?</p>

<p>These were the questions Grace O’Malley discussed
with de Vilela and myself, and the answers to
them did not present themselves at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can it be,” asked my mistress&mdash;and her words
showed the direction in which her thoughts were
turning “that Sir Nicholas has heard Richard Burke
is coming with all the men of Mayo behind him to
our aid, and that he has decided to engage him
before attacking us?”</p>

<p>“He is perhaps making some engines with which
he hopes to batter down your walls,” said de Vilela.</p>

<p>“Our ordnance will prevent that,” said I.</p>

<p>“I think the Governor must himself expect to
receive ordnance from some quarter,” said de Vilela,
“otherwise the success of the siege he must know is
impossible.”</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley and I looked at each other, the
same thought in our minds. There was only the one
way by which there was any probability of his obtaining
heavy pieces, and that was over sea.</p>

<p>Did Sir Nicholas reckon on the support of a
heavy ship of war, and was he now quietly looking for
its arrival? Had he foreseen, or, at least, provided
against the failure of the plot of the kernes?</p>

<p>That seemed very likely, and the more I thought
of it the more likely did it seem. I now realised, as I
had not done before, the seriousness of our situation.</p>

<p>“That must be it,” said Grace O’Malley. “That
must be it. He is not a man given to slackness, but
he is perfectly aware that he can now effect nothing
unless he has cannon, and so he tarries until his
ordnance comes. Doubtless he has arranged that a
war-vessel shall meet him here, and, if that is how
the matter stands, it may arrive very soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you have conjectured,” said, de Vilela,
“will, I think, prove to be correct.” And I also said
that her words expressed my own opinion.</p>

<p>Now, the three great galleys lay in the harbour
at Clare Island, and as Grace O’Malley had withdrawn
most of their crews they were without sufficient
defenders, and might be easily taken and
destroyed.</p>

<p>“The galleys must at once be brought over here,”
said she with decision to me, “or better still, if it
be not too late, sailed into Achill Sound, and hidden
away in one of its many bays. This very night, as
soon as the darkness has fallen, you, Ruari, must take
as many men as can be got into the boats we have
here, and make for Clare Island with all speed.
When you have reached the island, do with the
galleys as seems best to you.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the shadows of night had overspread
the land and the sea, I set about to fulfil
her behest. The day-breeze had died away, and the
waters were calm and tranquil as we pulled out from
the castle. Rowing steadily and strongly along the
north shore of Clew Bay, the sound of our oars alone
breaking the silence, we held on until we arrived
at Clare Island, where I was overjoyed to find our
ships riding at anchor in the peaceful security of the
haven.</p>

<p>And there, partly to rest my weary men, and
partly because I could see no reason for any
immediate action, I resolved to lie still till dawn.</p>

<p>I had hardly, as it appeared to me, laid myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
down to sleep in my cabin on <i>The Cross of Blood</i>,
though some hours had passed, when I was aroused
by Calvagh O’Halloran, who had been left in charge
of the galleys, with the tidings that the watchers
he had placed on Knockmore had come down from
the hill with the intelligence that they had seen,
in the first light of the morning, the tops of the masts
of a large ship coming up, faint and dim, on the
south against the sky.</p>

<p>Springing from my couch, I bade Calvagh get
the galleys ready to put to sea, and while this was
being done I went ashore, and, climbing the slope
of Knockmore with swift steps, gazed seaward at the
approaching vessel.</p>

<p>At first I was inclined to hesitate as to what to
make of her, but as I looked, and as she kept coming
on into fuller view, any doubt I entertained was set
at rest.</p>

<p>There was a bright flashing of flame, then a heavy
boom from one of her ports, succeeded by three shots
fired in rapid succession.</p>

<p>I concluded that she was still too far out at sea
for her commander to have intended these for anything
but signals, and therefore I continued to stand
watching her, my purpose being to discover if she
intended to make for Clare Island or would hold
on towards the mainland.</p>

<p>This took some time, for, as the breeze was off
the shore and against the tide, she sailed very slowly.
At length it became apparent that she was to
endeavour to go on to Burrishoole or Carrickahooley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and so would have Clare Island well on her left, for,
as she passed the Point of Roonah, she was swung
around between us and the coast.</p>

<p>I could tell from her movements that her captain
was far from being certain where the channel lay
among the islands that stud all the eastern side of
Clew Bay; and, indeed, it takes a man who knows
these parts more than well to steer a ship of middling
tonnage safely through the rocks and shoals into the
fairway by Illamore. I felt confident that it would
be many hours before he could reach his destination,
and this put into my mind to attempt to carry
out a project which had occurred to me, and which
might prevent him from ever reaching it at all.</p>

<p>The project was of a somewhat desperate nature,
and if it resulted in failure then in all likelihood
there would be an end so far as regards <i>The Cross of
Blood</i> and its company; but if success should favour
our enterprise, we might compel Sir Nicholas to raise
the siege before it was well begun, and so bring
the war to a close for the present by his retreat.</p>

<p>As I was weighing the chances both for and
against us, there sounded forth from the English
ship-of-war a single loud report, and shortly afterwards
three shots were fired&mdash;a repetition, in fact,
of the former signal. This acted on me like the
pricking of a spear on a charger.</p>

<p>What I had in view was nothing less than the
wreck of the enemy’s vessel.</p>

<p>When I had regained the deck of my galley
the anchor was weighed, and we put out into the bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
leaving <i>The Grey Wolf</i> and <i>The Winged Horse</i> in
the harbour, with orders to follow us on the next tide.</p>

<p>Summoning Calvagh to my side, I unfolded to
him the course I thought of pursuing, and as much
would depend on the stoutness and endurance of
our rowers, I enjoined on him to exhort them to be
steadfast, and not to be thrown into a fury and a
frenzy of excitement even when they heard the
shots of the Englishman roaring past their ears and
we seemed to be going to certain destruction.</p>

<p>They were not to abandon their places at the
benches unless <i>The Cross of Blood</i> should be so
damaged by the enemy as to appear to be in a
sinking condition. Should that disaster be imminent,
then, and only then, would it become a case of
each man for himself.</p>

<p>I judged it to be needful to give these instructions
because, while I could trust everyone of my
men where a matter of fighting was concerned, I was
not so sure that when it came to our running away&mdash;and
that was the very soul of my scheme&mdash;they
would do as I wished with an equal heart. For
they were of the temper in which it is easier to fight
and die than to flee and live.</p>

<p>As we drew out from Clare Island the English
ship was about two miles in front of us, with her
bows pointing for the south side of Illamore, between
which and the rocky islets opposite it there is a clear
span of water, but before she could come abreast of
Illamore there was a distance of a couple of leagues
of open sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>She went along lumberingly, and the galley,
bounding forward like a racer under the swift,
measured swing of the oars, had the speed of her,
and began to come up with her rapidly. When
we were within a mile of her, and Illamore perchance
a league away, I shifted my course and bore off to
the north.</p>

<p>The galley had no doubt been seen by the
Englishmen as soon as we had emerged from Clare
Island; and now, when they perceived that we were
heading away from them and going north, they
fetched about and came round after us.</p>

<p>Would their captain give chase, or would he
content himself with noting whither we went and
following us for a time and then turning about
again? I had felt certain from the beginning that
he had no pilot on board, for where were there any
people who knew Clew Bay but ourselves? And
sure was I that no O’Malley would ever guide a
hostile ship through these waters.</p>

<p>What I feared was that the Englishman might
pursue us for two or three miles, and then, seeing
how thick the islands were in that part of the bay
and how narrow the channels between them, might
be deterred from proceeding further in our direction,
and therefore stand off again for the other side of
Illamore, as had been his purpose at first.</p>

<p>As I was determined to draw him on at all
hazards, I made a sign to Calvagh, at whose word
our oarsmen ceased pulling their great sweeping
strokes, and made no more than a pretence of rowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
so as only to keep steering-way on <i>The Cross of Blood</i>,
and to deceive the Englishman into imagining that
he was catching her up, as indeed he was, though
not as he understood the matter.</p>

<p>On he came, as I had hoped, the gap between
us growing less, until a ball fired from his bows
fell so near as to warn me that we were within range
of his guns.</p>

<p>The English vessel was a heavily armed ship, her
sides bristling with large pieces of ordnance, and it
would have required not more than a few of her
shots, had they struck the galley, to send her to the
bottom. And as there were but two falconets on
<i>The Cross of Blood</i>, her other cannon having been
removed from her to the walls of the castle, we were
not able to reply to the enemy’s fire with any effect.
But it was not my intention to use these falconets,
except to lure him into that trap I was setting for
him.</p>

<p>Therefore I shouted to Calvagh, and the galley
plunged forward again under the strong, full beat
of the racing oars as he ran up and down between
the rowers commanding them to pull for their
lives. We could hear the cheering and the laughter
on board the Englishman as he watched what he
took to be our frantic efforts to escape.</p>

<p>And, in truth, we had put on this burst of
speed none too soon, for the shots now sent after
us fell so little short of our stern that I was afraid
we were lost. But the peril passed, and we quickly
drew away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus for two miles or more the pursuit
of us went on, the Englishman coming up with us
and discharging his pieces at us as we slacked off
rowing, and then falling behind us as the oarsman
drove the galley on again. I repeated this manœuvre
several times, and once only had a ball struck <i>The
Cross of Blood</i>, but, as fortune would have it, without
inflicting any serious injury upon us.</p>

<p>Now that the supreme moment was almost at
hand I became conscious of a singular tumult, a
very fever in my veins, and that at a time when
I desired above all things to be calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>I was standing by the helmsman as he steered,
and, as I turned to give him the direction, I could
see in the pallor that showed beneath the brown
of his skin, in the fixedly gleaming eyes, in the
shut lips that had no colour about them, in the
whole tense attitude of the man, the visible expression
of my own feelings.</p>

<p>For there before us lay the islands; all shapes
and sizes were they, some grim and bare, others
green and fair to see; island upon island, one crowding
upon the other, as it were, like a wide range
of low hills.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of us a grey, craggy rock
reared its head; on one side of it was a small,
round islet, a shining girdle of spray half hiding
it, on the other, separated from it by a narrow
passage, a great rampart of black cliffs, on whose
heights the eagles loved to build, towered aloft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
into the sky, the waves rolling themselves in empty
thunders at its feet.</p>

<p>Beyond this passage was seen a spacious land-locked
bay as it appeared to be, so closed in did
it seem on all sides by islands. And through this
passage did I give command to go.</p>

<p>There was a mute protest in the look the
helmsman gave me, for this passage is none other
than that called the Gate of Fears, and no mariner
ever makes use of it save from direst necessity
and with many crossings of himself and murmured
vows. But the galley made a half-turn obedient
to the helmsman’s hand, and so was headed for
the dreaded Gate.</p>

<p>The Englishman was at our heels, bent upon
our capture or destruction, but when he saw us
approach this passage he hesitated, and was like
to draw back. Whereupon I ordered Calvagh to
bid the oarsmen stop rowing, and bringing the
falconets into position trained them on the enemy,
myself putting the blazing torch to the touch-hole.</p>

<p>At the same time our sailors sent up a loud
taunting, derisive cry, which was answered back
full-throated by the English ship. Provoked beyond
endurance at us, and thinking, it might be, that
where a large galley like <i>The Cross of Blood</i> might
go she might venture also, she again came on at
us, firing as she came.</p>

<p>I had to endure an agony of suspense, for there
was still time for two things to happen, either of
which would be fatal to my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Until the English commander had fairly entered
the Gate of Fears, and so would be forced to go
on, he might hold off after all. That was the first.
And to tempt him on I had to keep the galley
so close to the range of his ordnance that it was
very probable that he might hit and sink her.
That was the second.</p>

<p>He had, however, made up his mind that we
were within his grasp, and had determined to have
us. As he came slowly nearer, our oarsmen sent
the galley on through the passage, and on he moved
after us.</p>

<p>There was now a lull in his cannonading, and
a strange silence fell upon us all. In that silence
I waited anxiously, a prey to mingled doubts and
fears, expecting to hear a slight grating, scraping
sound, and to see the galley shiver and quake as
she passed over the knife-edges of rocks that lie a
few feet below the surface of the sea at the further
end of the Gate. The tide was high, as I had
reckoned, else I never would have attempted it.</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden tempest of smoke and
flame from the Englishman, in the midst of which
<i>The Cross of Blood</i> swayed and reeled as if she had
been struck. I sickened with apprehension, but
the swaying and the reeling quickly ceased. We
were safely over the jagged barrier of rock; we had
passed through the Gate, and were in the deep water
beyond.</p>

<p>Below me I could see Calvagh’s white, set face
as he looked up; then, as he realised that we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
out of the dangers of the passage, a war chant broke
from his fierce lips, the oarsmen rowing mightily,
and keeping time to that savage, deep-chested music
of his.</p>

<p>And on behind us came the unwitting Englishman.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more, looking towards her, I
saw her bows tilt up and then plunge high into the
air. She was lifted up and dashed down again
and again on the rocks, so that her back broke,
and she was torn to pieces before my eyes, while
some of her sailors cast themselves into the water,
with outcries and bewailings very piteous to hear,
and others got into the ship’s boats and put out
to sea, where I know not what fate overtook them.</p>

<p>My men clamoured that they should be pursued,
but this I would not suffer, for my end was attained,
as Sir Nicholas now would have no ordnance for
the battering down of the walls of Carrickahooley,
and must therefore raise the siege.</p>

<small>THE SIEGE IS RAISED.</small></h2>


<p>Perchance it was that my spirits had been affected
by the sinking of this fine ship, even though I myself
had been the cause of the same&mdash;the loss of a
vessel, I cannot help saying, being a thing more to
be deplored than the deaths of many human beings;
or it may have been that my mind, now the
necessity for prompt and decisive action had passed,
became, as it were, relaxed and unstrung; but, as
<i>The Cross of Blood</i> threaded her way through the
maze of the islands towards Carrickahooley, I could
think of nothing save of how I stood in the debt
of de Vilela.</p>

<p>In vain I strove to comfort myself by recalling
the successes and the victories that had been
achieved by and in the name of my mistress,
Grace O’Malley, and by telling myself that she had
won for herself and us an imperishable renown.
Not thus could I silence the voice of my heart,
which cried out that all these were but as barrenness
and as nothingness so long as Eva O’Malley
was not for me. For <i>there</i> was the pain, there the
grief and the sadness.</p>

<p>Against myself did I consider myself called upon
to fight. I was as deep in the Spaniard’s debt as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a man could be, and yet I could not bring myself
to resign all hopes of my dear, even to de Vilela,
without the bitterest struggles.</p>

<p>Which of us twain possessed the maid’s love?
Was it de Vilela, or was it I? Did she love either
of us?&mdash;that was the all-important question. For
myself, my love had grown with my growth, was, I
felt, growing still, and would keep on growing as
long as I lived.</p>

<p>De Vilela, however, was a stranger, blown in
upon us, as it were, by the chance winds of heaven.
My claim was perhaps the better claim, but a maid’s
heart acknowledges no real claim but the claim of
her love, and if her heart’s love was de Vilela’s,
then was my claim void and empty indeed.</p>

<p>Therefore, let the maid decide. My thoughts
had worked round to this point, when I remembered
once more what Grace O’Malley had said
about the Don and Eva. What if Eva loved me
after all? Again, Let the maid decide, said I.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow, this did not altogether satisfy me.
Then it occurred to me that I might pay a part
of my debt to de Vilela in the following way.</p>

<p>He could scarcely tarry much longer with us at
the castle, as he must soon depart to endeavour to
carry out the objects of the secret mission with
which he had been entrusted by his master, the
King of Spain. The way for him would be clear
and open, for I had no doubt that Sir Nicholas
would not now be able to continue the siege, and
that we would be left in peace and quiet till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
spring of the next year, when the war would most
probably be renewed against us with larger forces,
and with greater determination, both by land
and sea. But all that lay in the womb of the
future.</p>

<p>As for Don Francisco, I thought it likely that
he would try to make the most of the time
that remained to him before setting out for the
Earl of Desmond’s, that he would ask for Eva’s
hand from Grace O’Malley, and that thus the
matter would be determined. What I set myself
to do was, so long as he remained at Carrickahooley,
to keep out of Eva’s presence, and in a manner, as
it were, to leave the field to de Vilela.</p>

<p>If the maid loved him, I was out of court; if
she loved me, she would tell her foster-sister that
she could not accept the offer of the Spaniard; if
she cared for neither of us, or wavered between us,
then I was resolved to forego whatever advantage
I possessed over de Vilela until he had received
his answer and had taken his departure.</p>

<p>If she accepted his suit, they would be married,
I supposed drearily, before he left, and then they
would set out together, and that which was unutterably
and unalterably rare, dear, and precious
would be gone out of my life. If Eva willed otherwise&mdash;it
all rested with her. But, in any case, de
Vilela was to have his chance free from any mean
or unmannerly interference from me.</p>

<p>Little did I guess how severely the strength
of my resolution was to be tested, but I thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
God, now that all is done, that it bore the
strain.</p>

<p>It was not much past the middle of the day
when <i>The Cross of Blood</i> drew up at Carrickahooley,
but long before we had reached the castle we could
hear the sounds of battle rolling towards us from
off the land, and could see the tiny clouds of
smoke made by the arquebuses as they were fired
off.</p>

<p>Disembarking with all haste, and bringing with
me most of my crew, I was instantly admitted
within the water-gate. There I was told that
Grace O’Malley, with de Vilela, her gentlemen,
and most of her people, was making a sally on
the English.</p>

<p>Rushing to the parapets, I could see that the
centre of the fighting was between the castle and
the Abbey of Burrishoole, and that it was of a very
terrible and bloody character, the Englishmen displaying
that dogged courage for which they are
famed, while the Irish, inspired by their mistress,
performed wonderful feats of valour, and were
thrusting their enemies slowly back to their principal
position, where, however, their further retreat
was speedily checked on their being strengthened
by fresh supports.</p>

<p>Now the purpose of Grace O’Malley in this
outfall could not have extended beyond inflicting
upon the Governor considerable loss, as she knew
his force was far superior to her own in numbers;
and I was therefore not surprised to witness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Irish at this juncture beginning to retreat, the
English attacking them fiercely in front and on
their flanks.</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Sir Nicholas, who
was himself directing the operations of his troops,
conceived that he might cut our people off altogether
from the castle by sending forward some
soldiers he had held as a reserve, and placing
them between the Irish and the castle.</p>

<p>I could see all this quite plainly from the walls,
and, fearing lest he might succeed, I summoned my
men, and, issuing from the castle gate, marched to
meet this new body of the enemy, in order, if so be
I was in time, to defeat the attempt, which, if well
carried out, could not but be attended with the
greatest possible danger, and perhaps disaster, to my
mistress.</p>

<p>Being delayed by the roughness of the ground
from coming up as quickly as I could have wished,
and as they had the start of us, the English had
effected their purpose, and the Irish were surrounded.</p>

<p>But, as we ran forward, some of the enemy faced
about to meet us, and so, being taken, as it were,
between two fires&mdash;Grace O’Malley with her men on
the one side, and I with mine on the other&mdash;they
were speedily thrown into the utmost confusion, of
which we did not fail to make a good account.
Still the contest was by no means entirely in our
favour, for the resistance of the Governor’s soldiers
was protracted and bitter, each man contending for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
his own hand with all the strength and cunning he
was possessed of.</p>

<p>At length the main body of the Irish under
Grace O’Malley fought their way through the enemy
and joined themselves to us, my mistress being both
surprised and rejoiced to find that we had returned,
and had been able to come to her assistance. Beside
her, their swords gleaming redly in their hands, were
Brian Ogue, and Art, and Henry O’Malley, and the
other gentlemen of her household; and leaning upon
the arm of one of them, and supported and protected
by two men, I beheld de Vilela, desperately
wounded!</p>

<p>His face was pale, drawn, deep-lined, and spotted
with blood, the eyes being closed, and the lips shut
tight; the figure within his armour was bent with
weariness, and weakness, and wounds; the fingers of
the right hand still grasped the handle of his sword,
but they shook and trembled as with palsy. Truly,
he looked like one whose doom is sealed, and my
heart went out to him with a great compassion.</p>

<p>Calling to four of my men, who were armed
with spears, I caused them to make a rough litter
with their weapons, and upon this rude but soldierly
contrivance we laid the Spaniard, and so bore him
to the castle, while behind us the fight still continued,
but with less and less fierceness.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from Don Francisco, although
the jolting must have given him the most intense
pain, save once when my mistress took his hand
and spoke to him, when he made reply in Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that “all was well” with him. And I thought the
words were not unworthy, but well became the brave
soul of the man.</p>

<p>“I will go in with him,” said Grace O’Malley
to me, when we had arrived at the gate; “Ruari,
do you gather our people together, and lead them
within the walls.”</p>

<p>And I did her bidding, so that in a short time
I had them collected in a compact body, and under
cover of the ordnance, belching forth from the
battlements, retreated within the gate, bearing most
of our wounded with us. There I found Grace
O’Malley waiting to hear the news I had brought.</p>

<p>“De Vilela?” I first inquired.</p>

<p>“He is still alive,” said she, “but I fear the hour
of his passing is already upon him.”</p>

<p>“’Fore God,” cried I, with a sob in my throat, “I
trust not.”</p>

<p>“Eva tends him,” said she&mdash;and in a flash I
remembered everything.</p>

<p>“He is in good keeping,” said I.</p>

<p>“He is in the hands of God,” said she, in a voice
and manner so touched with unwonted solemnity and
deep feeling that I gazed at her in amazement.</p>

<p>Then a wild thought came to me: could she,
did she, our princess, care for this man? But no
sooner had the thought arisen in my mind than
I dismissed it. “What have I to do with love?”
she had said on a former occasion, and she had
meant it.</p>

<p>Her next words, however, appeared to give point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to my suspicion, but when I considered them more
carefully, I saw I was wrong. For what she had
said was, “There are few men like Don Francisco,”
but the tone in which they were spoken was not
that, it seemed to me, of a woman who loves; rather
was it that of one who deplores the expected loss
of a dear friend. Yet sometimes, in the silent
watches of the night, have I wondered&mdash;and I
wonder still.</p>

<p>“We have heard the roar of great guns from
time to time this morning,” said she, changing the
subject abruptly, “and, knowing that you had no
ordnance to speak of, I feared for your safety. Tell
me what has happened.”</p>

<p>Whereupon I related all that had taken place,
and how that the English war-vessel had been dashed
to pieces on the rocks at the hither end of the Gate
of Fears.</p>

<p>Much I spoke in praise of Calvagh and the rowers
of <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and said that it was fitting
they should be given a rich reward, for, notwithstanding
the terrors inspired in all seafaring men
by the place, and in spite of the ordnance of the
Englishman making the passage like the mouth of
hell, they had stood fast every one.</p>

<p>“And what of yourself?” cried she, between
smiles and tears. “What of yourself, my Ruari?”</p>

<p>And she took from the mantle upon her shoulder
a brooch of gold, with mystic signs, of which I knew
not the meaning, engraved upon it, and in the midst
of it a sapphire, with the deep blue in it of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
unfathomed abysses of the sea. This she handed to
me, one of her arms about my neck, and I was
uplifted with pride, albeit there was some shame
mixed with it too. But the gift I compelled myself
to decline.</p>

<p>“I may not take it,” cried I; for the brooch was
one of the tokens of her chieftainship to her people,
and firmly resolved was I that there, in the land of
her fathers, no man should ever have the slightest
cause to think there was any other chief save her,
and her alone. But if I took the brooch&mdash;”No,” said
I; “I may not take it.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing I was determined, she sighed, said
no more, but kissed me on the cheek&mdash;a thing she
had not done since I was a little child, playing with
her, a child too, on the sands of the shores of Clew
Bay.</p>

<p>Thereafter together we went into the chamber of
the main tower where de Vilela had been laid.
There by his couch was my dear, a presence soft,
tender, and full of sweet womanly pity and of the
delicate ministries that spring from it. There upon
the couch lay the wreck of a man; so calm, so pale,
so worn, that he looked like one dead.</p>

<p>“He still breathes,” said Eva, in a whisper.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the result of the conversation I
had just had with Grace O’Malley, or it may have
been the subtle influence of that scene, with that
quiet figure stretched upon the couch for its centre,
but there was no bitterness in my breast when
I saw Eva there. Who, indeed, could have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
any other emotion at such a time but that of
sorrow?</p>

<p>For two days de Vilela hung between life and
death. More than once did it seem that his spirit
had left his shattered body, and yet it did not. On
the third day the Spaniard rallied; Teige O’Toole,
our physician, declared that there was hope; and
from that instant Don Francisco began slowly to
recover.</p>

<p>All within the castle rejoiced, and I as much as
any; but when I saw how constantly Eva was with
him, and how the sick man was restless and uneasy
in her brief absences from his side, and how she
watched over and soothed and tended him, her mere
presence being a better restorative than all the
healing simples of Teige O’Toole, is it to be
marvelled at that I found the determination I had
come to of leaving the field open to him, and of
withdrawing from it, become more and more difficult
to maintain?</p>

<p>Neither did Sir Nicholas nor his army help
greatly to distract my thoughts. For there, outside
our walls, at a safe distance from our cannon, did
the Governor lie day after day for a long week,
waiting, doubtless, for the warship that never came.</p>

<p>We did not, on our side, stir out of the castle,
for whatever advantage, if any, had been reaped from
the sally had been purchased at too heavy a price.
Grace O’Malley rightly had come to the conclusion
that we had everything to gain by sitting still, and
that Sir Nicholas, seeing that he could do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
against us without ordnance, would soon grow tired
of this futile business, and so go back to Galway.</p>

<p>Whether he had heard in some way that the
vessel he had expected had been wrecked, or feared
that events had happened which had prevented it
from being sent at all by Winter, the English
Admiral, I know not; but one night he stole away
from Burrishoole, and when the morning was come,
lo, there was not an Englishman anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate coincidence in one respect
that the very morning which saw the siege raised
should also have witnessed the arrival of Richard
Burke, attended by fifty horsemen and more than
a hundred gallowglasses, for if we could have counted
on such a number of fighting men in addition to
our own, we should certainly have again attacked the
Governor’s forces and not stood so much upon our
defence.</p>

<p>But in another respect it fell out luckily enough
for us, and this was that we might now pursue
him with some hope of overtaking him, and of
stopping him from plundering the country, owing to
the assistance of the Burkes. There was nothing
more certain than that Sir Nicholas, as he retreated
towards Galway, would drive before him all the
cattle and horses of the land, and thus he would,
after all, unless prevented, gather an enormous spoil,
depriving us, and those who looked to us for
protection, of a great part of our wealth. And
already he had done us a vast amount of injury
and harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>So soon, therefore, as Richard Burke, who was
sorely disappointed that he had not reached Carrickahooley
sooner, had come into the castle, and had
been received and entertained by my mistress, from
whom he heard a narrative of what had recently
occurred, Grace O’Malley proposed that he and I
should set out with a large force to endeavour to
recover from the English the plunder they were
taking away. And to this the MacWilliam gladly
assented, observing that no proposal could please
him better than to take part in getting back her
property for her.</p>

<p>“And,” continued he, “as it is impossible for
Sir Nicholas to move quickly, hampered as he
must be with many herds of cattle and bands of
horses, we can catch him up before he has gone
very far.”</p>

<p>“You will also have many opportunities,” said
Grace O’Malley, “of which I am sure you will not
fail to make the most, of coming upon detached
bodies of his troops as they struggle through the
thick forests and the passes of the mountains, and
of cutting them off. You can harass and harry him
nearly every step of his retreat, so that when he at
length reaches Galway it will be with greatly lessened
forces, and with so slender a spoil that he will not
care to boast of it.”</p>

<p>“You would not offer him battle?” asked I.</p>

<p>“You must be the judges of that for yourselves,”
said she; “but Sir Nicholas is a fine soldier, and as
wary as a fox in warfare, and I think you can do him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
far more deadly hurt by acting as I have said. You
will risk but little, and may gain much.”</p>

<p>Then Grace O’Malley and Richard Burke began
talking of what prospect there was of a general rising
of the Irish against the Queen, and of the help that
might be looked for from Philip of Spain, and of
other matters, some of which, I suspect, lay even
nearer the heart of one of them, at least.</p>

<p>But of this I cannot tell, for when they commenced
to speak of affairs of State I went out from
the hall in which they were, to get my men in
readiness to pursue the English. And welcome to
me was it that our expedition, and its hard service,
held out the promise of drawing off my thoughts
from Eva and de Vilela.</p>

<p>I was eager that we should make a start at once,
but the Burkes were weary and footsore with their
long, toilsome journey. For that day, then, they
rested, Grace O’Malley giving them and all in the
castle a great feast, filling them with food and wine,
while her harpers stirred their souls with songs of
the mighty deeds done by the mighty dead.</p>

<p>Songs, too, they made to music now sweet, now
fierce, in honour of my mistress, acclaiming her as
not the least in the long list of a line of heroes!
Whereupon the castle rang with tumultuous shoutings
of applause. Then the minstrels cunningly
turned their themes to the Burkes of Mayo, English
once, but Irish now&mdash;ay, even more Irish than the
Irish themselves.</p>

<p>And so the day passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning we left Carrickahooley with a
hundred horsemen and a hundred running footmen,
besides horse-boys and others. Behind us came
many of the fugitives who had come to us fleeing
from before the English, and who now were
returning to their homes, or to what poor, charred
remains of them might be found.</p>

<p>As we moved swiftly on, we saw many evidences
of the havoc wrought by the ruthless invaders; here
the hut of the wood-kerne, who lives by hunting,
there the hovel of the churl, who tills the fields,
burnt to the ground; while over all brooded the
silence of desolation and death.</p>

<p>It was not till evening was upon us that we knew
by many indications that we were close on the
enemy. Then we halted and waited till the night
had fully come, sending out in the meantime our
spies to see what the English were doing.</p>

<p>Softly, like thieves, they returned with word they
had discovered that Sir Nicholas and the greater
portion of his army were not to be seen, having
apparently gone on, but that a small company of
English soldiers and most of the O’Flahertys of
Aughnanure were camped some two or three miles
away, having in their charge great droves of cattle.
Having no thought that they were being followed
up by us, they had made no preparations
for defence, and therefore might easily fall into
our hands.</p>

<p>Leaving our chargers to the care of the horse-boys,
we divided ourselves into two bands, Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Burke being in command of the one, and I of the
other; and, going very circumspectly so as to give
no hint of our approach, we burst upon the enemy,
many of whom were slain at the first onset, but a far
larger number escaped us in the darkness. We spent
the rest of the night in their camp, having secured
the cattle; and when daylight made manifest everything
to us I saw that we had accomplished all this
victory without the loss of a single man, there being
but few wounds even among us.</p>

<p>Then we rode on that day and two more, now
and again falling in with scattered companies of the
enemy, whom we slew or dispersed, and recovering
from them whatever plunder they were taking out
of the land. But Sir Nicholas we did not meet with,
as he had gone on day and night without halting,
having heard, as I afterwards learned, that the
Burkes of Clanrickarde, under Ulick, the son of the
earl, had brought together several hundred men,
including many Scots, and that they were even now
threatening Galway itself.</p>

<p>As we were not purposed to go on to Galway after
the Governor, we returned to Carrickahooley at our
leisure.</p>

<p>And now, as we journeyed northwards, Richard
Burke’s talk to me was all of his love for my mistress.
How brave, how strong, how great she was!
And of how wonderful a spirit and so wise
withal! Did I think that she had a regard for
anyone in especial? Or, that he might have a
chance with her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus he talked and talked, until I, who had
my own love trouble, and found it hard enough, was
first constrained to listen, then to utter words of
sympathy, and, last of all, was unfeignedly glad
when our arrival at the castle put a stop to the outflowing
of his eloquence.</p>

<small>“OUR NATURAL LEADER.”</small></h2>


<p>“The Earl of Desmond,” said Grace O’Malley to me,
“is our natural leader against the English, and I wish
you to go and see him.”</p>

<p>These words my mistress addressed to me shortly
after Richard Burke and I had returned. She and I
were alone, and, indeed, she had sent for me expressly,
so that I knew it was of some matter of importance
she wished to speak to me. I had not anticipated,
however, that it would be this.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “When do you desire me to go?
De Vilela will hardly be able to be moved for some
time yet, and I suppose that he will accompany
me.”</p>

<p>Don Francisco was better, but several weeks
would have to elapse before he would stand on his
feet, or even be moved from his bed with safety.</p>

<p>“No,” said she. “I do not think it prudent to
wait so long a period as may have to pass before
de Vilela has sufficiently recovered. You must take
Fitzgerald with you, and set out at once for the
Desmond stronghold at Askeaton. Fitzgerald is now
nearly well, his wound being all but healed. He
possesses something of the confidence of the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Spain, which Don Francisco enjoys to the full, and is
therefore in a position to speak with Desmond, and
to find out what his intentions are.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” said I, not without gladness, for it
would be a way, and that a perfect one, to enable me
to keep my resolution with regard to Eva and de
Vilela&mdash;if I were out of the castle altogether, then
indeed would the field be left to him alone. But, at
the same time, there was a gripping about my heart
that certainly was not caused by pleasure.</p>

<p>“It would be most unwise to delay,” continued
she. “Sir Nicholas Malby will come against us so
soon as he can raise a large army; if not Sir Nicholas,
then another; if not this year, and he will scarcely do
so now the winter approaches, then next year. And
thus will the contest go on till the end has come.
Under Desmond, the head of the Geraldines, the
greatest noble of the South, all the Irish people
will rally.”</p>

<p>My mistress’s voice was full of excitement; but I
was not so sure of Desmond, and so made haste to
remind her that he had been out against the Queen
before, and had got nothing but imprisonment and
grievous loss for his pains.</p>

<p>“It is not the same now,” replied she, with her
ardour undiminished; “for Philip of Spain will throw
his sword into the balance. When Desmond understands
that he will be backed up by the ships and
the soldiers and the money of Spain, he will throw off
all irresolution, and show himself to be the great
prince he is. Tell him that we are with him heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and soul. Tell him that the Burkes, both the Upper
and the Lower Burkes, will forget their feuds, and
unite for this one common purpose. Tell him there
will be no lack of treasure; and as an earnest of this
we will now go to the Caves of Silence, and take from
thence the chest of gold found on the <i>Capitana</i>&mdash;I
have spoken to de Vilela about it&mdash;and some gems
as well, as a present from me.”</p>

<p>My mistress’s mind was made up, and vain would
it have been for me to try to cause her to change her
determination. And why should I try? Was not
what she said true? Was not Desmond a prince in
the land? If he could not be depended upon to lead us
against the English, then on whom could we
depend? So I stifled whatever of doubt I felt.
Grace O’Malley was my leader, and if she were
content with Garrett Desmond, then so was I.</p>

<p>We went together to the Caves of Silence, and
brought away from them the chest of gold, a casket
richly chased and adorned with rare jewels, and a
dagger, the handle and sheath of which were studded
with precious stones.</p>

<p>“What hatred of the English may not accomplish,”
said my mistress, “gold will. Many a good
sword may be bought when neither love nor hate
would affect aught; many a waverer made steadfast
on the rock of gold.”</p>

<p>I was to sail early next morning in <i>The Cross of
Blood</i>, and in the evening when I sat in the hall, she
straightly charged me that I was on no account to
adventure the ship or myself in any sort of peril, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
that I was not to attack any vessel, however fair and
goodly a prize it might seem; nay, on the contrary, I
must keep out of the track of ships as far as was
practicable.</p>

<p>When the two ladies left us for the night, and I
rose to bid them farewell for a time, I held Grace
O’Malley’s hand, and she pressed mine warmly. I
would have given all that I had in the world, or ever
hoped to possess of it, if Eva would but have clasped
my hand with something of the same fervour, or that
I could have held hers and caressed it with a lover’s
fondness.</p>

<p>And the eyes of my dear, too, were soft and kind,
so that my heart cried out for a token, but my debt
to de Vilela stood between us, and I only touched
the little hand.</p>

<p>She looked at me somewhat strangely, I fancied,
as if the coldness of my manner made her marvel,
and I think that there perhaps was a faint gleam of
laughing malice in the face of Grace O’Malley, who
stood by. But in the morning, there, at the window
high up the tower, were to be seen both my
mistresses, with their fingers to their lips kissing
me good-bye, as the galley was pulled out from
the harbour.</p>

<p>It was now October, a month of storms, and we
had to encounter head winds, heavy seas, and much
stress of weather, so that our progress southward was
slow. Keeping close in shore, we took advantage
of whatever protection the coast, or the islands
along it, afforded us, having frequently to put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and stop in one or another of the bays of Connaught.</p>

<p>A full week was thus taken up before we had
gotten through the South Sound between Inisheer
and the mainland, and, with the exception of some
fishing boats, we had had the sea to ourselves.</p>

<p>As we passed down the rocky, mountain-crowned
coast, we were sorely buffeted and wrought upon by
the winds and waves. By the time we were abreast
of the Cliffs of Moher, so furious a tempest was raging
that I feared never would we live through it.</p>

<p>The stoutness of the galley, however, and perhaps
some skill of seamanship, brought us safely to the
Head of Cregga, which we essayed to round, but
experienced so great a travail in the doing of it, albeit
we did it, that we were well-nigh exhausted with the
labour. But, once round the Head, we found ourselves
in a stretch of water which, by comparison
with that we had gone over, was as a quiet pool, to
wit, the Bay of Liscanor.</p>

<p>And here we remained for some hours, looking for
such an abatement of the storm as would allow us to
proceed; but in this our hope was not to be realised
as soon as we had expected, for the night fell, and
the fury of the tempest was not spent.</p>

<p>The first object that met our gaze when the light
of morning had come was a ship, all her masts
gone, and the waves sweeping over her, go driving to
her doom on the rocks of Cregga. As now her bows,
now her stern was lifted up, so that we got a full view
of her hull, there was that about her that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
me not unfamiliar, but I could not say then what it
was. Clutching the ropes and bolts on and about
what remained of her bulwarks were a few men,
clinging desperately in the face of death to their last
hold on life.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of the ship being saved,
and there was hardly a greater likelihood of saving
the lives of any of these miserable sailors, but I
resolved to make the attempt, at least.</p>

<p>Bringing up <i>The Cross of Blood</i> as near as I
dared to the Head, and having made ready to lower
her two small boats, I waited for the moment when
the vessel would crash upon the rocks, and be
crushed and broken upon them. As she neared
the cliffs, the spume of the waves shooting high
and white in the air, the foaming, roaring waters,
dashed back by the rocks, caught and twisted her
about, so that, as her side was turned to us, I saw
her name in letters of white and gold.</p>

<p>She was <i>The Rosemary</i>, a shot from which had
caused the death of my master, Owen O’Malley, a
few months before, and well did I remember how
I saw her sail up the Shannon on her way to
Limerick, with the two eerie figures shadowed
against her canvas.</p>

<p>For an instant I felt an impulse to stand off, and
to make no effort to avert the fate of any of her men&mdash;it
was uncertain, I told myself, whether at the best
I could render them any assistance. But, after all,
we had no quarrel with these wretched mariners,
about to be swallowed up by the ever-hungry sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and, if we had had, this extremity of theirs was of a
kind which we could not look upon as our opportunity
and have been worthy of the name of men.</p>

<p>Therefore, when <i>The Rosemary</i> rose to the waves
for the last time, and was borne aloft on the black
edge of a huge roller, and then shattered to fragments
upon the rocks, did we keep a sharp look-out for
the bodies, living or dead, if any, which might appear
on the water near where we were.</p>

<p>And five poor souls, by means of our boats, did
we save alive, or, being as the dead, did bring to
life again&mdash;and one of them was a woman.</p>

<p>Surely this was the queerest trick that fate ever
played upon me, for the woman was none other than
Sabina Lynch! Nor do I wonder that, when she had
come to herself and, seeing me, knew upon whose
ship she was, she did imagine she had but escaped
from one kind of calamity to meet with another,
and that perhaps worse: for she had to be restrained,
and that by force, from casting herself back into the
sea, preferring death to being in my hands.</p>

<p>And, verily, I was in a grievous quandary with
regard to her.</p>

<p>She would not eat nor drink nor rest nor sleep,
but only cried and sobbed and moaned, till she fell
into a sort of stupor. Recovering after awhile,
she did naught but cry and sob and moan again,
and was so distraught that I felt a pity for her.
Then, what was I to do with her? True, I could
keep her a captive, and take her back with me
when I returned to Carrickahooley, and give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
over to my mistress, who would doubtless accord
her the grimmest of welcomes. And this,
perhaps, was my duty. If it were, I failed in
it.</p>

<p>Urged on by a woman’s spite and jealousy, Sabina
Lynch had played a treacherous and cruel part in
regard to Grace O’Malley, and she was, in a measure,
the cause of our quarrel with Sir Nicholas and the
English. Sure was I that my mistress would not be
merciful to her, nor would she expect me to be.
Why, then, should I have been?</p>

<p>I have no other answer, if it be an answer, except
that I was deep in love with Eva O’Malley, and that
my love for her made me feel certain that Eva, much
as Grace was to her&mdash;as to me&mdash;would have told me
to act as I did towards this woman. For I determined
to let her go free.</p>

<p>It is not in me to explain this matter further,
nor to tell how often I argued it with myself, ever
coming back, however, to what I conceived would
be the desire of Eva&mdash;to let Sabina Lynch go. And
if the other course was my duty, there was meted
out to me, as will be seen, punishment out of all
proportion to my fault.</p>

<p>Having come to the conclusion that Sabina Lynch
should be set at liberty when a suitable opportunity
presented itself, I acquainted her with my decision.
She could scarcely believe her ears, and was not
convinced that I meant what I said until I informed
her that she might move about the galley as she
pleased, and that I would put her ashore at Liscanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
if she wished it, or take her on with us if that was
her will.</p>

<p>When she saw that I did not intend to deceive
her, nor to do her any hurt, she told me that she was
going to Limerick. Inquiring why she had left
Galway, I now heard of the rising of the Upper
Burkes under Ulick, the son of the Earl of Clanrickarde,
which had caused Sir Nicholas to hurry
back to that city&mdash;as I have before recorded. It
appeared that the people of Galway were in the
extreme of terror, as nearly all the fighting men of
the place had been withdrawn from it, and from
Athlone, where was the next English garrison, as
well, for the expedition against Grace O’Malley, and
the city was thus left without defenders.</p>

<p>The Burkes had met with no resistance on their
march to Galway, and the city was in great danger
of being taken and sacked. A way out, however,
remained, by the sea; and so grave was the state
of affairs that Stephen Lynch, the mayor, had gladly
availed himself of an opportunity of sending his
daughter away for safety by <i>The Rosemary</i>, which
happened to be leaving for Limerick. Along with
her had also gone several ladies of Galway, but they
had all perished in the wreck.</p>

<p>I now informed Sabina Lynch that I was bound
for the Shannon, and that I would put her ashore
at some point on the river near Limerick, if our
voyage had a favourable termination, but that I
thought it would be better for her to land here at
Liscanor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>However, she replied that she had friends at
Limerick, but knew no one in Liscanor, and so
begged to be allowed to remain on <i>The Cross of
Blood</i>. She prevailed upon me with her entreaties,
and I consented&mdash;wherein, God wot, I was weak
enough, though nothing short of her death could
have prevented what was to occur.</p>

<p>There is a saying among us Celts, “What will
be, already <i>is</i>,” and this saying is true.</p>

<p>The day which succeeded that on which <i>The
Rosemary</i> was destroyed saw us out of the Bay of
Liscanor, and, the weather being propitious, the
next found us entering the mouth of that most
beautiful of all the beautiful rivers of Ireland, the
Shannon. But it was not until two days later that
I brought the galley into the bay of the creek upon
which, some miles inland, stands Askeaton, the
fortress of the Desmonds.</p>

<p>During this time, being fully occupied with the
working of the ship, I had seen little or nothing of
Mistress Lynch, who, however, had had many conversations
with Fitzgerald, and often did I hear
them laughing and jesting, the one with the other,
as if there were no such things in the world as bad
weather and storms, and shipwrecks and war, and
the deaths of men.</p>

<p>Now the bay in which the galley lay was no great
distance from Limerick, and as it would have been
the height of madness to go any nearer that city,
which could not but be very hostile to us, I told
Sabina Lynch that our journey was at an end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
that she was free to go. Whereupon she thanked
me, and along with Fitzgerald, who had offered
himself as her escort for part of the way, and who
was well acquainted with the country&mdash;for it was
all the territory of the Geraldines&mdash;left <i>The Cross
of Blood</i>.</p>

<p>On his return, he and I, accompanied by some
of our men, and taking with us the presents sent
by my mistress, set out for Askeaton, where we
were received by the Earl of Desmond.</p>

<p>The castle was one of the largest and most formidable
in Ireland, consisting of several towers and
strongly built houses and stables, the whole surrounded
by high walls around which flowed the
waters of the creek, so that it looked like a town
on an island in the middle of a lake. A village, with
a church at one end of it, stood on the rising
ground that led up from one of the banks of the
stream over against the castle.</p>

<p>When the drawbridge was lowered&mdash;Fitzgerald
making the matter of an entrance easy for us&mdash;and
we had passed within the walls, I saw in the yard
a considerable number of the gallowglasses of the
Geraldines, some having arquebuses, but most of
them only spears or battle-axes and swords.</p>

<p>One of the knights of the Earl’s household approached
us, and said that his lord was ready to
see us. Fitzgerald and he&mdash;they were cousins, it
appeared&mdash;began at once to talk, and they introduced
me to several other gentlemen whom we met. And
so we went into the presence of the Earl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Grace O’Malley had said that he was “our natural
leader” against the English, and narrowly did I scan
the features of Garrett Desmond as he rose from
his chair to offer me his hand.</p>

<p>My first impression was that of extraordinary
disappointment, for I could see nothing very notable
about him. Then, as he spoke, I noticed a twitching
of the lips that strongly savoured of indecision, to
say the least, and also that his eyes roamed restlessly,
not settling fixedly on man or thing for a
single instant. And as I observed him the closer,
the keener was my disappointment.</p>

<p>Yet this noble was a great power in the land.
Once the Desmond war-cry was sounded forth from
Askeaton, thousands would shake their spears in
ready response. He had but to say the word and
the whole South-West of Ireland would spring to
arms. He had said it once and might say it
again, but I distrusted and misliked him from the
first.</p>

<p>Courteously, however, did he receive me, and
graciously the gifts which I presented to him in
the name of my mistress. He inquired of me many
things respecting her, to all of which I replied to
the best of my ability. Indeed, during the time I
spent at Askeaton, he never appeared weary of
hearing about her and her exploits, which seemed,
he said, incredible in one so young.</p>

<p>Then, after we had feasted together, he called
Fitzgerald and myself aside and took us into an
inner room where we three were by ourselves. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
now Fitzgerald told him of the help, both in men
and money, which Philip of Spain promised in the
event of a general rising against the Queen, and
I repeated to him all the words which Grace O’Malley
had charged me to say to him.</p>

<p>Never once did I take my glance off him, but
he would not meet my eyes. For the most part
he paced up and down the room, and one could
easily see the travail of his mind in the working
of his face. At one moment there would be gladness
and the look of resolve, then doubt and gloom
would take their place the next. The same uncertainty
could be seen even in his walk, which was
now swift, now slow.</p>

<p>At last he said that it was a heavy matter, and
not lightly to be undertaken, and invited me to stay
at the castle until he had considered it more at large.
I pressed for an immediate reply to my mistress,
but he asked me to tarry for a few days, and, as
I could not well do otherwise, there did I remain
until one morning he gave me a letter for Grace
O’Malley and many presents for her and myself,
and so dismissed me.</p>

<p>During the time I waited for his answer I heard
from several that a Spanish army was looked for in
the spring, and I could see that the Earl knew all
that was going on. Therefore I did not doubt but
that he had sent a message to my mistress that
would please her well.</p>

<p>And while I was thus waiting, the hours hanging
heavily on my hands, I made myself well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
with the castle&mdash;its towers and strong rooms and
walls&mdash;and thus acquired a knowledge which was
to stand me in good stead before the end was
come.</p>

<p>Then it was Ho! for <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and
Ho! for Carrickahooley, which we reached after
a voyage unmarked by any incident worthy of
record.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>A DEAR VICTORY.</small></h2>


<p>Chiefly by reason of the tempestuous weather, my
journey to Askeaton and back again had occupied
not far short of a month,&mdash;which was a much longer
time than had been reckoned upon. On my arrival
at Carrickahooley my mistress was naturally very
impatient to hear what was the response of the
Earl of Desmond to her message, and also what
my opinion of that noble was.</p>

<p>First of all I delivered to her the letter and
the presents he had sent. When she had read his
letter she handed it to me, and there was, I could
see, a great light of happiness on her face. But
when I had glanced over the missive, I was not so
satisfied with its contents as she plainly was.</p>

<p>The letter was not a long one, and, in brief,
was nothing more or less than an invitation from
Desmond, asking my mistress to go on a visit to
him at Askeaton, where his countess would give
her a warm welcome, so soon as spring was come, or
as early as would be convenient for her.</p>

<p>With regard to any rising against the Queen he
said not a word, but intimated that he was very
desirous of meeting one of whom he had heard so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
much, and of discussing with her such matters as
affected their mutual interests.</p>

<p>This last phrase Grace O’Malley took as a hint
that the Earl, not caring to commit himself to anything
definite on paper, was of the same mind as
herself, for they had no interests in common save
such as lay in the expulsion of the English from
the island.</p>

<p>Now the message my mistress had sent him was
frank and open, so that there could not be two
opinions as to its import. But these words of his,
it seemed to me, partook in no degree of the same
character. They might mean much or little or even
nothing at all, so vague were they.</p>

<p>If I had not seen the Earl my view might have
been different, but in the cloudiness of his letter I
again saw his weakness and want of purpose. I did
not, I could not, suspect him of anything worse.
However, Grace O’Malley, although I expressed to
her what I felt about Desmond, was assured that
he could only mean one thing, and that was that
he shared in her ideas, and would be ready to give
such effect to them as he could.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “Garrett Desmond is the man.”</p>

<p>And she was the more certain of this when I
went on to tell her that I had heard a great deal
at Askeaton, and that with hardly a pretence of
secrecy, of the army which the King of Spain was
to send in aid of the Irish the following year.</p>

<p>“Do you not see,” said she, “that Desmond
must be heart and soul in the business, or else he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
would have suffered none of this talk of Philip of
Spain?”</p>

<p>I had, indeed, made a similar reflection when
at Desmond’s castle, but what I distrusted was the
character and strength of the man himself. But
my mistress was my mistress, so I said no more
then of the Earl.</p>

<p>I had had no small disputings with myself as
to whether I should tell Grace O’Malley about what
had occurred with respect to Sabina Lynch or not.
I could not blame myself, albeit these very searchings
of my spirit did show some doubt if I had done
what was best, and tell her I did.</p>

<p>Whereupon for a minute she fell into a fit of
silent rage, which, however, presently passed away&mdash;the
only thing she said being the question, sharply
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“Would you have acted in that way, Ruari, <i>if
it had been a man</i>?”</p>

<p>And the sting of the taunt, for such I felt it to
be, lay perhaps in its truth. Howbeit, neither of
us ever referred, in speaking to each other, to the
matter again.</p>

<p>Richard Burke and his followers had left the
castle, and had gone back to their own territory.
He had made me the confidant of his hopes and
fears with regard to his love for Grace O’Malley,
and I desired greatly to know how he had sped in
his wooing.</p>

<p>It was not, however, till long afterwards that I
discovered he had pressed his suit, and that not alto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>gether
without success, but that she would give him
no definite promise so long as her affairs were in so
unstable a condition.</p>

<p>I did not know of any man in all the world whom
I esteemed a fit mate for her, but the MacWilliam
had many things in his favour, not the least being
that he was a valiant soldier. That he had ranged
himself on her side in her quarrel with the Governor
also had its weight with her. I think, however, that
at this time he had a very small share in her
thoughts, as she was entirely wrapped up in the
Earl of Desmond, whom she looked upon as the
Hope of Ireland, and in the furtherance of her
plans.</p>

<p>De Vilela was still at Carrickahooley, and had
so far got healed of his wounds that he was able to
be about for an hour or two each day. He greeted
me with his never-failing courtesy, and after I had
seen more of him I noticed that the air of melancholy
gravity he had borne during the siege had
in nowise changed, unless it were by being even
deeper than before.</p>

<p>The sufferings he had undergone and the feebleness
he still endured might easily have accounted for
this. But I was persuaded that there was another
reason, although it took me some time to arrive at
this conclusion.</p>

<p>What put me in the way of it was that I caught
him, when he believed himself free from observation,
looking at me, not once, nor twice, but often, with a
wistful intentness, as if he were trying to read my very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
thoughts, and so to pierce to the innermost soul of
me. Why was this? Why was he thus weighing me
as it were in the balance?</p>

<p>Eva was not so much with him now that he was
regaining his strength, and, whether he was with her
or not, he had not the look of a happy lover, that look
which, me thinks, would be present notwithstanding
pain and the shadow of death.</p>

<p>And I put the two things together, though not
hastily, for I feared nothing so much as to be wrong
in this, and guessed that he had lost all hope of her
for himself, and was asking himself whether, if so be
she loved me, I was in any way worthy of her. But I
think the chief care of this very noble gentleman of
Spain was not pity for himself, nor my worthiness
or unworthiness&mdash;which is the truer word, but that
this woman whom he loved should have her heart’s
desire, on whomsoever that desire might fall, and at
whatsoever cost to himself.</p>

<p>I did not perceive this in one day, or for many,
and, pursuing the course I had before determined on,
abode firm in my resolve not to appear even to come
between him and Eva O’Malley.</p>

<p>The winter wore on to the day of the Birth of
Christ, and all was quiet and peaceful in Connaught.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, did the new year open&mdash;it was
that year of grace, 1579&mdash;when messengers from
various chiefs in the north-west of Ireland began
coming to and going away from Carrickahooley.</p>

<p>Sometimes their business was with my mistress,
but still more frequently was it with de Vilela, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
it had gone abroad that he was with us, and that he
was in the confidence of the King of Spain, from
whom he had a mission to the Irish. Among these
were some of the MacSweenys of Tir-Connall, who
spoke for themselves and also for their prince,
O’Donnell, whose wife was a Macdonald, and a kinswoman
of my own. Many were the plots on foot,
my mistress striving to bring about a great confederacy
of the north.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas Malby, after he had repulsed the
Burkes of Clanrickarde and driven them back to
their mountains, lay at Galway darkly meditating
schemes of vengeance. But, for the present, with
the land all about him in a ferment, he did nothing
but bide his time.</p>

<p>Indeed, by the coming of spring, the whole island
was stirring with the fever of war, some looking to
Spain, and some to Desmond, so that the commanders
of the English, from the Lord Deputy at
Dublin to the poorest of his captains, were in sore
trouble and disquiet.</p>

<p>So passed the winter away.</p>

<p>“Darkness and blood; then a little light,” had
been the saying of Teige O’Toole, the Wise Man.
Now was the time of the little light of which he
had spoken; it was immediately to be followed by
the period of which he had said, “blood and
darkness, then again light, but darkness were
better.”</p>

<p>It was in April, then, of this year of fate that de
Vilela, having perfectly recovered of his wounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Grace O’Malley bade me get <i>The Cross of Blood</i> in
readiness to convey him to Askeaton.</p>

<p>De Vilela was anxious to be gone, having trespassed
upon our hospitality, as he said, beyond all
measure. And he was the more eager as now he
knew for certain that Eva had nothing stronger than
a friendship for him. He had not asked her, I
imagine, so sure was he that she did not love him,
and it was like the man, that, knowing this, he would
not vex her even with words.</p>

<p>At the last moment, and unexpectedly, my
mistress determined to sail with us, and Eva
O’Malley also came, Tibbot being left in charge at
Clare Island and Carrickahooley.</p>

<p>With fair winds, and hopes as fair, did we leave
Clare Bay behind us, and for two days all went well.
On the third day of the voyage, the wind having
changed, the watch descried a ship coming up
against the line of the sky, and when we had observed
her for a short time we saw that she was
making towards us. Being much higher out of the
water than the galley, she had no doubt seen us
first.</p>

<p>We edged in closer to the land, which loomed
up some miles away on our left; whereupon she
shifted her course as if to cut us off. As she came
within nearer view she appeared to be a great ship,
carrying many pieces of cannon, and flying the
English flag. The morning sun fell upon her, and
disclosed her deck covered with men whose armour
and weapons sparkled in the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>It was abundantly evident that she was a ship-of-war
of the English, and well prepared in every
respect to attack and overwhelm us. Both as regarded
her ordnance and the numbers of her crew,
that she was vastly superior to us was plain. Should
she get the range of us I made no doubt that we
should be quickly knocked to pieces.</p>

<p>On the high seas, a galley like <i>The Cross of Blood</i>
could not be opposed to such a ship except
with the one result, and that the worst. Our case
was little short of desperate, but I did not lose
heart.</p>

<p>Nor did my mistress give up hope. She and I
held a hurried consultation with Calvagh O’Halloran,
and determined that we should first try to escape
by rowing. There was the land before us, and a
rocky cape jutting from it held out, as it were, a
friendly beckoning hand.</p>

<p>Once we had made it, and were safely round it,
we would be in a shallow bay, into which flowed a
river&mdash;up which the galley might go, but not so
large a ship as the Englishman. We therefore bent
our whole energies to this end, but all in vain. It
became apparent before we were half-way to the
shore that we were completely outsailed, and were
at the mercy of the enemy.</p>

<p>When I had fully grasped the extreme peril in
which we were, and reflected that my whole world
was on board this galley, to say nothing of the fact
that every timber of it was dear to me, my heart
well-nigh fainted within me. Here was that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
woman whom I served; here also the woman whom
I loved.</p>

<p>Was it to this destiny they had been born?
Notwithstanding our danger, I could not believe it.</p>

<p>What was the worst that the spite of fortune
could wreak upon us?</p>

<p>Either <i>The Cross of Blood</i> would be sunk by
the enemy’s fire, and we would perish in the sea,
or she would be captured, many of us being killed
in the struggle, and the rest taken&mdash;what would be
their fate?</p>

<p>But there was no need to ask that; for I was
well assured that the people of the English ship
knew who we were, or, at least, whose galley it
was, for who in Ireland had such a vessel as <i>The
Cross of Blood</i>, except Grace O’Malley?</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts when my mistress
spoke in my ear, and said that as it was impossible
to escape from the Englishman we must
fight him.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” cried I; “but how?”</p>

<p>Then she told me what to do.</p>

<p>I went forward to Calvagh, and bade him order
his oarsmen to row with all their might until I
gave a signal; when it was given they were to get
their arms ready, but without making a noise or
leaving their benches, and having their oars resting
on the water.</p>

<p><i>The Cross of Blood</i> raced on, but the English
ship went faster, until a shotted gun fired across
our bows made us well aware of what we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
known sufficiently already&mdash;that we must be sunk,
or give ourselves up, or, at least, appear to do
so.</p>

<p>Calvagh looked at me, but I gave no sign.
Grace O’Malley changed the galley’s course, so that
we gained a little by it; and on we plunged again,
making for the open sea. But the advantage we
had thus obtained was of no real value to us, and
the Englishman, with his square bulging sails swelling
in the breeze, was quickly at our heels.</p>

<p>And now a second and, as it were, more peremptory
message of iron bade us throw up the game
and lie to. The great shot fell so close to the
poop of the galley, and made so heavy a splash in
the water, that the spray from it might almost
have fallen on our deck but for the wind. I glanced
at my mistress and she nodded.</p>

<p>There was no purpose to be served in rowing
any longer, for in another second we might be sent
below the waves. Nor did we make any attempt
to return the enemy’s fire, and so, perhaps, invite a
broadside from him which would probably have
settled our affairs for ever.</p>

<p>Calvagh’s eyes were fastened on me, and now I
gave him the signal; his voice roared hoarsely
through the galley; the oarsmen sat erect on their
benches, and the rowing ceased.</p>

<p>Something that was between a sob and a groan
came from the lips of our men; a sort of quiver
passed over them, as each of them quietly got his
sword or battle-axe from its place; and then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was a silence, only broken by the waters as they
lapped along our sides and swished under the blades
of the oars.</p>

<p>De Vilela, who had gone into his cabin to put
on his armour as soon as the chase of us began,
now appeared. Approaching my mistress and me,
and in accents tremulous as I had never before
heard from him, he asked a question of Grace
O’Malley.</p>

<p>“Señorita,” inquired he, “tell me, you do not
intend to give up the galley thus tamely to the
English? Surely it were better to die.”</p>

<p>“Better to die,” said she, “yes, by the Cross!”
And then she rapidly spoke a few words, which I
could see were not displeasing to him. And I like
to recall the man, as he stood beside me that day;
clad in his suit of mail, with the crest of his house
shining on his helmet, his naked sword drawn,
its point resting on the deck of the poop; and
his eyes bright and steadfast, while a smile was
on his lips. And we looked towards the English
ship, saw the scowling faces of our foes hanging
over her bows, and waited on the will of the God
of Battles.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley in the meantime went down to
her cabin to speak words of hope and comfort to Eva.
When I thought of my dear, my heart again fainted
within me; then it seemed to grow so big and strong,
calling, as it were, loudly to me to play the man this
day, that I felt there was nothing that was wholly
impossible to me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>My mistress now returned to the poop-deck, and
taking the helm from the steersman, as we stood
close in by the enemy’s vessel, she put it down
sharply, so that the galley was thrown into the fore-chains
of the Englishman.</p>

<p>“O’Malley! O’Malley! O’Malley!” I cried, and
quicker than a flash, before the English had got over
the suddenness of the movement, our men, with
de Vilela and myself at their head, had leaped on
board of her.</p>

<p>With thrust of sword and blow of battle-axe we
made good our footing on the deck, and for a space
the English fell back before us. Their captain, a
towering figure in armour, save for his head, on
which was a broad cap with a dancing plume of
feathers in it, rallied them, and led them on at us,
shouting for St. George and England.</p>

<p>They were more in number than ourselves, but
despair nerved our arms, so that we withstood them,
albeit we were hard pressed, and the fighting was
terrible beyond all words. I sought to engage the
captain, but de Vilela was before me.</p>

<p>Then there occurred an unexpected and almost
unheard-of and incredible thing.</p>

<p>I knew the voice at once, and, turning in the
direction from whence it came, and thus being partly
off my guard, could not altogether ward off the dart
of a sword, so that I was wounded in the throat, and,
had it been but a little truer, would have been slain.</p>

<p>Above the clang of meeting weapons and the
rattle of armour and the shouts and sobs and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
catchings for breath of the foemen, the voice of my
mistress was heard crying in the tongue of the Irish:</p>

<p>“Let the O’Malleys divide, and stand on each side
of the ship!”</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter in itself to accomplish,
and some there were of the Irish who were unable
to do so; but such of us who could obeyed her
command without pausing to try to understand what
she would be at.</p>

<p>Then there came forth a great tongue of fire, a
blinding cloud of smoke, and so tremendous a report
that the ship was shaken from stem to stern.</p>

<p>And this is what had taken place:</p>

<p>When we had sprung on board of the English
ship, Grace O’Malley was left standing at the helm
of <i>The Cross of Blood</i>. She had watched the contest,
and, fearing that we were overmatched, had cast
about for some means of assisting us. Then, taking
with her a few of the men whom she had kept in
the galley for her own guard, she had climbed up
into the forecastle of the enemy, and, as their attention
was entirely occupied with us, had, unperceived
by them or seen too late, run in board one of the
Englishman’s bow-chasers, and had turned it on its
owners.</p>

<p>The piece, thus levelled at this terrible short
range, swept the deck of its defenders, and among the
heaps of the slain and the wounded were several
of our own people who had not been able to gain
the bulwarks.</p>

<p>I was myself leaning against one of the ship’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
beams breathing hard, and clutching with the fingers
of my left hand my bleeding throat, while my right
still grasped my sword. So dreadful was the sight
of the deck that now met my eyes that I could
not help closing them, while a shudder shook my
whole frame.</p>

<p>But our work was not yet done. For when we
essayed to carry the poop we were beaten back in
spite of all our endeavours, and what might have
been the end I know not if Grace O’Malley had
not held possession of that piece of ordnance. A
second and a third discharge from it shattered and
destroyed the poop, and at length the ship was ours,
its whole crew being killed or captured or drowned,
for many of the English jumped into the sea and
perished.</p>

<p>Having collected her men together, and along
with them having brought away the prisoners and
what treasure was found on board of <i>The Star of the
Sea</i>, which was the name of the ship, she ordered
it to be scuttled, and then withdrew to the galley.</p>

<p>But when we came to count up what this battle
had cost us, our loss was so great that my mistress
deemed it expedient to go no further with her
journey at that time, and thus we returned again
to Clew Bay, having been absent but a few days.
And there was much mourning among us, for many
of our people had been slain. De Vilela, however,
had come unscathed from the fray, and my
own wound was, after all, not much more than a
scratch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>But the uncertainty of the issue of our whole
conflict with the English had been brought home
to me in so decided a manner that for the first time
I realised how dark and menacing was the path that
lay before our feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>AT ASKEATON.</small></h2>


<p>I was never one to whom it is easy to sit still with
folded hands, still less the man to muse darkly for
long over the chances and mischances of war. Mine
certainly was it not to consider and to see the end
of a thing even from its beginning; the hour and
its work were enough for me. Scarcely, then, were
we come back but I burned to be again on the water
with the deck of <i>The Cross of Blood</i> beneath my feet,
and rejoice did I exceedingly when my mistress told
me what her purpose now was, and bade me get the
three galleys ready for sea.</p>

<p>She was resolved to put her whole fortune on the
hazard, and to employ her entire strength in the
struggle, and, at the same time, to get what aid she
could from others.</p>

<p>Thus, undeterred by our encounter with the
English ship-of-war&mdash;from which we had so hardly
emerged&mdash;nay, rather made the more determined by
it, she had sent messengers, fleet of foot and strong,
to Richard Burke, the very day we had arrived at
Carrickahooley, inviting him to come to her with his
best and his bravest, and, if he would serve her, as
he had professed himself ready, to tarry not by
the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>I was nowise in doubt as to what the answer
of the MacWilliam would be. Not only was he
committed as much as we ourselves to the contest
against the Governor, but he had promised to support
Grace O’Malley in any manner she might desire; nor
could I imagine anything that would give him a
keener pleasure than to comply with her request.</p>

<p>Two or three weeks passed, however, before he
appeared at the castle, but when he did come it was
at the head of a picked company of his gallowglasses,
two hundred strong.</p>

<p>In the battles and fights of the previous year
our force had been reduced by perhaps a third, and
our numbers had been still further lessened in the
bloody engagement with <i>The Star of the Sea</i>. Welcome,
then, were these stalwart Burkes of Mayo.
True, they were unused to the sea, but it was my
mistress’s intention that we should all land, and hold
ourselves at the disposal of the Earl of Desmond.</p>

<p>“If need be,” said she, discussing her plans with
Richard Burke and me, “I will burn the galleys
behind me.”</p>

<p>Whether I fought on the sea or on shore was a
matter of indifference to me; but I could not hear
her say this without a pang, although I recognised
to the full the spirit which inspired the words.</p>

<p>“There will be no necessity for that,” said de
Vilela, who was present, smiling, “for the ships of
my master, the King of Spain, will sweep the sea
clear of the English.”</p>

<p>It was the month of May, and the earth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
arraying herself once again in her garments of green,
when we weighed out from the harbour of Clare
Island.</p>

<p>At first, the weather being unsettled, we made but
slow progress; however, on the night of the second
day of our voyage a fair wind sprang up, and on the
fourth day we were in the Shannon, going up with
the tide, under a blue sky warm with the promise
of summer. Casting anchor between the Island of
Aughinish and the mainland for the night, I went
ashore to see if I could hear any tidings of Desmond,
or if anything was known of the expected ships
from Spain.</p>

<p>The sight of the three galleys had drawn a
number of the peasants to the bank of the river, and,
when I had dispelled their fears of us, I found that
they were willing enough to talk. Howbeit, they
could tell us nothing of Desmond, nor had they any
word of the Spanish ships.</p>

<p>When I had repeated this to my mistress on my
return, she asked me to go next day to Askeaton, and
to inform the Earl, if he were there at his fortress,
that she was on her way to him, but if he were
absent to ascertain where he was. Accordingly I
proceeded in <i>The Cross of Blood</i> to the bay into
which flows the stream on which the castle stands,
and arrived at my destination.</p>

<p>As I was already well known at Askeaton I was
admitted within the gate without demur, and almost
the first man I met was Fitzgerald, who greeted me
with much warmth. But I had not conversed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
him long before I perceived that he did not seem
to be in his accustomed spirits, and when I told
him that my mistress, Eva O’Malley, Richard Burke,
and de Vilela were no great distance away, he
appeared to be somewhat distressed.</p>

<p>“Is Garrett Desmond here?” I asked, and the
usually frank expression of his face was instantly
clouded over.</p>

<p>“He is expected back at the castle to-morrow,”
he replied. Then as I looked hard at him, waiting
to hear more, he broke out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Desmond went to Limerick yesterday in attendance
on the President of Munster.”</p>

<p>“The President of Munster!” I exclaimed. Then
I stopped in the courtyard, put my hand on his arm,
and gazing earnestly at him, asked, “What is the
meaning of this?”</p>

<p>The President of Munster was the English
Governor of all this part of Ireland, and I could
not but think this was a strange piece of news.
That he and the Earl of Desmond should be
together, evidently on terms of friendship, boded
no good to Grace O’Malley, or to myself, or to
our cause.</p>

<p>“O,” said Fitzgerald testily, “the explanation is
simple. The country is excited over the prospect of
the coming of ships from Spain, and the President rode
over from Limerick to Askeaton to see Desmond&mdash;ostensibly
on a visit merely of courtesy, but in reality
to spy out what was going on here. I would not
have suffered him to enter the castle had I been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Desmond, but Desmond thought otherwise, saying
the time was not yet ripe.”</p>

<p>This was plausible, but did not account, I thought,
for the moody looks of Fitzgerald. There was something
behind all this, but I did not press him further,
save to inquire&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is to prevent the President from seizing
Desmond, and thrusting him into prison at
Limerick?”</p>

<p>“He has a strong guard,” said he, “and the President
has very few soldiers in Limerick. Besides,
he feels confident that Desmond will be true to the
English.”</p>

<p>“Has Desmond given him any pledge of good
faith?”</p>

<p>“No. He places his trust in Desmond too fully
for that.”</p>

<p>When I thought over what I had been told, it
seemed probable enough that the Earl concealed his
real intentions under the mask of a pretended loyalty
to the Queen, and would do so perhaps until the
time, as he said, was ripe. Yet the uneasiness I
always felt with respect to him increased in spite of
this supposition.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me that perchance Fitzgerald,
now that he had had time to become better acquainted
with his cousin, was not more satisfied
with him than I, and that this was the reason for
his change of aspect.</p>

<p>However, when I met the Earl next morning, my
suspicions and fears melted away before the cordiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
with which he received me. And when I told him
that my mistress was in the vicinity, he declared that
there was nothing he desired more in all the world
than to see her.</p>

<p>“The President of Munster,” said he, “has just
gone back to Limerick from here, and for a time at
least we will be free from his spying on us. Nothing
could have fallen out better,” he continued, rubbing
his hands together like one who was greatly pleased,
“so tell your mistress to make haste and come.”</p>

<p>Likewise his Countess, who was with him, bade
me say to Grace O’Malley that she was welcome to
Askeaton.</p>

<p>When I returned to my mistress, I repeated to
her the messages; but I thought it right to tell her
also that Desmond had been entertaining the President
of Munster. As I dwelt upon this matter,
and remembered Fitzgerald’s manner, something
seemed to knock at my heart, and my suspicions
sprang up anew.</p>

<p>“He finds it needful,” said Grace O’Malley, thinking
of Desmond, “to wear a double face as affairs
stand at present, but when the Spaniards arrive he
will come forward without disguise as our leader.”</p>

<p>And, in truth, when we were come to Askeaton,
both the Earl and his Countess made so much of
my mistress that I felt a sort of shame that I had
ever had any distrust of him.</p>

<p>Great entertainments were given in her honour,
all the noblemen and gentlemen of Desmond’s household
vying with each other in paying her court, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the Earl himself seemed never to be able to see
enough of her. Indeed, he showed her so much
attention that it soon became apparent that she
occupied a large part in his thoughts&mdash;so much was
this the case that Richard Burke grew very jealous
of him, nor did the Countess of Desmond regard the
matter without displeasure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the time was slipping by. Our galleys
lay in the stream, and though I visited them frequently
to make sure that they were safe, I could
not but be aware that it was no good thing that they
should be there, tied up in the Shannon, within easy
reach of any English man-of-war that might ascend
the river.</p>

<p>They were concealed, however, from view; but
there was ever the fear in my mind that a rumour of
our being at Askeaton would be bruited abroad, and
come to the ears of the English. All the Burkes, and
a considerable portion of our own O’Malleys, had been
withdrawn from our vessels, and the force left upon
them could scarcely be reckoned as formidable.</p>

<p>Another cause for uneasiness was that nothing
more was heard of the landing of the Spaniards. I
had many conversations with de Vilela, who was
certain of their coming, but who knew the time of it
no more than myself. He did not exhibit the impatience
which possessed me, but in his heart I doubt
not he longed for action as ardently as did I.</p>

<p>Of Fitzgerald I saw very little, for two days after
the arrival of my mistress at Askeaton he rode over
to Limerick, and there remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>When I spoke of him to de Vilela, he said he had
heard that Fitzgerald was madly in love with a lady
who was staying in that city, and that that probably
accounted for his being there. Knowing what Fitzgerald’s
disposition was, I could not forbear smiling,
and now fancied that I had discovered the cause of
his want of spirits in that he had not been very
successful in his wooing.</p>

<p>I thought no more of him or of his affairs, little
dreaming who the lady was, until the mention of her
name one day filled me with lively feelings of
astonishment and vexation, and, as I pondered this
new and perplexing turn of events, with something
close akin to terror.</p>

<p>It so happened that I was talking and jesting with
one of the Geraldines, when the conversation came
round to Sir Nicholas Malby, and the iron rule he
had imposed on Galway and a large part of Connaught.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley,” said he, “was more than a
match for him.”</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas,” said I, “is the best soldier the
English have in Ireland, and if he did not prevail
against my mistress, it was rather because he underrated
her strength and her prowess, than from any
other reason. He esteemed her as no more than a
feeble woman, and so was deceived.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” asked he, “are you well acquainted
with Galway?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;well enough,” replied I, somewhat crisply.</p>

<p>“And do you know the Mayor of the town, one
Stephen Lynch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I assented, wondering.</p>

<p>“A great merchant?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“The richest in Galway, perhaps in Ireland,” I
answered.</p>

<p>“With a daughter, an only child, who will inherit
his whole wealth?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, wondering still more.</p>

<p>“Mistress Sabina Lynch?”</p>

<p>“The same,” said I; “but why do you ask these
questions?”</p>

<p>“The woman is beautiful, is she not?” he went
on, without replying immediately to my query.</p>

<p>“No doubt of that,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Rich and beautiful!” he exclaimed, and then he
laughed very merrily.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said I again, “why have you sought to
know all this?”</p>

<p>“Ask Dermot Fitzgerald,” said he, and would say
no more, but I understood&mdash;all.</p>

<p>Dermot Fitzgerald was in love with Sabina Lynch!
And she was in Limerick, where were the President of
Munster and his soldiers, and Fitzgerald too! Here,
indeed, was a pretty heap of faggots, and it was my
hand, as it were, that might have placed the fire
beneath, and set it in a blaze!</p>

<p>I saw at a glance how easy it would be for Fitzgerald,
without intending in any way to do mischief or
to betray us to the English, to let drop a word or a
hint that might suggest to a quick-witted woman to inquire
further into his meaning, and that so dexterously
as not to excite in the least any alarm on his part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>And what might not be looked for when she
learned that Grace O’Malley, the woman she hated
most, and Richard Burke, the man she loved best,
were together at Askeaton? And Fitzgerald was
said to be madly in love with her! He would therefore
be as wax in her hands, and she could mould
him to her will as she pleased. Small wonder, then,
that I was disturbed, and felt that we were far
from secure.</p>

<p>And now there fell out what, at the time, gave
me the keenest regret and even pain, though afterwards
it proved to be of the most inestimable service
to us.</p>

<p>It had become very plain to anyone who gave it
the slightest thought, or, indeed, to anyone who used
his eyes, that Desmond was infatuated with my
mistress. Every moment that he could find was
spent in her society, to the neglect of other matters,
however important they were. Before he had seen
her he had been fascinated by what I had told him of
her and her deeds; now that he saw her for himself,
and marked how like a queen she was, he was as one
bound hand and foot before her.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley had a great power over men when
she chose to exercise it; and now, on her side, she
appeared not only to encourage him, but also to be
bent upon his complete subjugation.</p>

<p>I marvelled at her, yet assured myself that she
could have no love for the man, but that, perceiving
the weakness of his character, she took this course in
order to make certain of his firm adhesion to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
cause. But it was a course full of danger, for the
strength of the passion of a man, even of a weak
man, is no more to be reckoned up and measured
than is the force of a mighty tempest, beginning in
a breath and dying out in ruin.</p>

<p>Desmond’s countess grew pale and silent, and I
noted that the furtive glances she stole at my mistress
were touched at first with dismay, then with anger.
She must have known the kind of stuff of which her
husband was made, but her rage, as might be seen,
was directed wholly against my mistress. I felt a sort
of compunction, and sometimes wished that we had
never come to Askeaton at all.</p>

<p>And this wish was made much stronger, for
Richard Burke, who bore and endured for awhile
the utmost torture when he saw how matters stood
between Grace O’Malley and the Earl, told me that
he could suffer to see it no longer, and so was determined
to speak to her and remonstrate with her.</p>

<p>What passed between them I do not know, but
it was of such a nature that the MacWilliam shortly
afterwards withdrew in high dudgeon from the castle
with all his men.</p>

<p>I attempted to restrain him from going, but in
vain. He admitted that he had received no promise
from Grace O’Malley of her hand, but as she had not
repulsed him utterly when he had preferred his suit
to her, and had come to Kerry at her request, he had
hoped that the matter was in a fair way to be settled
as he desired. Now, he said, she had no thought of
him, her whole mind being taken up with Desmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>I endeavoured to gainsay this, but without success,
and I had sorrowfully to witness the departure of
the Burkes from Askeaton. I so far prevailed upon
him, however, that he agreed to stay in the district,
and, having obtained permission from the Earl, he
pitched his camp a few miles away in the woods.</p>

<p>Richard Burke’s troubles made me think of my
own love affairs, which were in the same position
as before, for, albeit, I had a secret, satisfying
conviction that Eva O’Malley had no special regard
for de Vilela, I still adhered to my resolution not
even to appear to come between them. Wherein,
perhaps, in my stupid pride, I did my dear, to say
nothing of myself, a great injustice, for she might
have supposed that I cared for nothing but the
fierce, mad joy of battle. But never loved I anyone
save her alone.</p>

<p>It was on the second or third day after Richard
Burke had left us that the arrival of the messengers
from the President of Munster with a letter for
Desmond threw me into a state of great concern.
And when I knew what the tenor of that letter
was, I was disquieted the more, for I could but
conclude that what I had dreaded would happen
with respect to the intimacy of Sabina Lynch and
Fitzgerald had indeed come to pass.</p>

<p>The Earl received the President’s messengers with
some state, several of his gentlemen and myself being
with him.</p>

<p>As he read the letter they presented to him, he
was evidently disconcerted by its contents, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
now at it, now at the messengers; but when he had
perused it a second time, he laughed strangely, and
said he would give no answer at once, but would
consider what was to be done.</p>

<p>In the evening, when we were all together in the
great hall of the castle, my mistress also being of the
company, he was in a boisterous humour, and bade
his harpers sing of the glories of the house of
Desmond. He sat beside Grace O’Malley, and I
saw him, under cover of the music, speaking to her
very earnestly; and presently he called me up to
them.</p>

<p>“What think you, Ruari?” said my mistress,
and her eyes danced and smiled, “what think you,
does the President of Munster ask from the Earl of
Desmond?”</p>

<p>“What is his demand?” cried I.</p>

<p>“Nothing less or more,” said she, and the laughter
suddenly went out of her face, “than that he should
instantly deliver up a certain Grace O’Malley, as a
notable traitress to the Queen and a spoiler of ships,
at present lodged in his castle of Askeaton, and
should forthwith cause her to be conveyed to him
at the city of Limerick, to be there dealt with
according to her deserts and the pleasure of her
Highness. What think ye of that?”</p>

<p>“What says the Earl of Desmond?” cried I.</p>

<p>“What, indeed!” said she, answering for him,
and turning to him with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ay&mdash;what, indeed!” said he, meeting her look,
and smiling back at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant there was a commotion at the
further end of the hall, and there entered a man,
with his garments stained with travel and befouled
with mire.</p>

<p>As soon as de Vilela saw him he sprang forward
with a great cry of delight, and, careless of us all,
embraced him, while a sort of silence came upon
us, and the bards ceased their singing; but the
whisper soon and quickly ran among us that the
Spaniards at last were come.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>THE LANDING OF THE SPANIARDS.</small></h2>


<p>It was a strange moment.</p>

<p>There were the representatives of the President
of Munster, two of the justices from Limerick&mdash;these
stood for the Queen.</p>

<p>There were Grace O’Malley, her gentlemen, and
myself&mdash;proclaimed rebels.</p>

<p>There were Desmond and his Geraldines.</p>

<p>And now here were de Vilela and this stranger
from Spain! And we were all met together in the
great hall of the castle of Askeaton.</p>

<p>A strange moment, and a strange meeting!</p>

<p>De Vilela advanced towards Desmond, and, with
that grace of manner which this man possessed in
greater perfection than any other I have ever seen,
presented the new comer to the Earl. I leant forward
to catch the name. It was the family name of the
famous Lieutenant of Santa Cruz, the still more
celebrated Grand Admiral of Spain. A brother or
a cousin of Martinez, I said to myself, as the two
men bowed low before Desmond.</p>

<p>“Will your lordship permit?” said de Vilela.
“Don Juan de Ricaldo, my friend and comrade!”</p>

<p>And the Earl extended his hand to Don Juan.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, señor,” said Desmond, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
without much warmth, for was he not, as it were,
between the devil and the deep sea, with England
on the one side and Spain on the other?</p>

<p>Then he conversed with the two Spaniards in
a low tone of voice, so that I could hear but imperfectly
what was said, but it was impossible not
to see that he was in great perplexity. The two
messengers of the President looked darkly on, their
countenances knit into scowls, while Desmond shot
a curious glance at them now and again.</p>

<p>After a few minutes spent in this fashion, Don
Juan, excusing himself on the score of being weary
in the extreme from his journey, retired from the
hall along with de Vilela. When they had withdrawn
there was a constraint upon us all, no one
caring to speak his thoughts, for what could we say
that would not have been noted by those two
sharp-eared gentlemen from Limerick?</p>

<p>For myself I was fair bewildered; but the one
thing that bulked out most largely in my mind
was the fact that now there must be an end of
our uncertainty, as the Spaniards had come into
the country, as I supposed, and the time for deeds,
not words, was upon us.</p>

<p>Nor was our sitting in the hall prolonged that
evening, for each one who was in authority preferred
to say nothing, and while the others talked
together in little knots, it was in whispers, and
all were glad when the Earl gave the signal for
retiring.</p>

<p>The same night I was awoke from a sound sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
by de Vilela, who bade me dress and go with him.
We went into a room high up in the tower, and
there were my mistress, Desmond, and de Ricaldo
waiting for us.</p>

<p>“Ruari,” said Grace O’Malley, her face bright
with excitement, “this gentleman is Don Juan de
Ricaldo”&mdash;we saluted each other&mdash;”and he is the
bearer of news of the highest importance, which
concerns us most nearly.”</p>

<p>Don Juan bowed again.</p>

<p>“The ships of the King of Spain have arrived?”
I asked, as my mistress paused.</p>

<p>“One ship has come,” said she, “that of which
Don Juan is the commander, and others are on the
way. They set out at the same time, but a storm
separated them; he has reached Ireland first, but
the rest cannot be far off.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the best of good news,” cried I. “Would
to God they were all beside our galleys on the
Shannon!”</p>

<p>“Don de Ricaldo’s ship lies off Dingle, on the
coast of Kerry,” said my mistress, smiling at my sally,
“and the others must be guided to the same harbour.
They may have already cast anchor elsewhere, or
they may still be at sea. But I wish you to take
<i>The Cross of Blood</i> and search for them. Both of
these gentlemen,” she nodded to the two Spaniards,
“will accompany you.”</p>

<p>“And then?” inquired I.</p>

<p>“You will then render them,” said she, “any help
they may require, as, for instance, choosing the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
suitable place for making a landing, or whatever
it may be.”</p>

<p>“And then?” asked I again.</p>

<p>“Return here,” said she.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said I, “if any plans have been
formed.”</p>

<p>“They will depend,” said Desmond, quickly “on
the number of the Spanish soldiers&mdash;and on other
things,” he added, more slowly.</p>

<p>“You will go at once, Ruari?” asked Grace
O’Malley, but her question was a command.</p>

<p>“At once,” I agreed; then a thought came to
me. “Richard Burke should be told of this,”
said I.</p>

<p>“All Ireland will have heard the news within
a week,” said Desmond impatiently, “and the
MacWilliam among the rest.”</p>

<p>This was true enough, but I made sure that he
knew, for I sent a trusty man to his camp who told
him what had taken place. I did this later that
night.</p>

<p>As I was taking my leave I asked my mistress
if she were satisfied that all was going well, and
she replied that she was.</p>

<p>“You will stay on here till I return?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Surely!” It was Desmond who spoke.</p>

<p>I had half a mind to suggest to her that it
might be better for her to go back to her own
galley, but it seemed like a presumption on my
part, and I held my peace.</p>

<p>But once we were on board <i>The Cross of Blood</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
swinging down the stream in the hours of the
morning, I wished that I had been bolder.</p>

<p>Yet, what was there to fear? So I repeated to
myself, but the fear came again and again. For
there were Grace O’Malley and Eva in Desmond’s
power, the guard they had with them being of the
slenderest now that Richard Burke was out of
Askeaton with his gallowglasses, and I myself, with
de Vilela and some of our choicest men, going
further away with every mile.</p>

<p>Was she justified in placing herself so entirely
in the hands of the Earl? There was the rub. My
mistress, however, had declared that she was well
pleased with the way in which our affairs were
moving, and with that assurance I had perforce to
be content. And I verily believe she had no doubt
but that she could do with Desmond as she chose.</p>

<p>I had been ordered to keep a look-out for the
Spanish ships, and I put in at various bays and
havens where I thought it might be possible that
they had anchored, but I reached Dingle without
having seen anything of them. And I well remember
that it was towards evening, after we had borne the
blaze of the July sun all day, that we came up
alongside of Don Juan de Ricaldo’s vessel, and de
Vilela and myself went on board of her with her
captain.</p>

<p>Next morning I put out to sea again, and,
sailing slowly down the coast for perhaps a couple
of hours, fell in with the rest of the Spanish ships,
tacking to the north-westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made signs that I wished to speak to
them, they lay to. As I approached I saw a man
waving his hand to me from the ship that was nearest
us, and him I afterwards knew to be Sir James Fitzmaurice,
a relative of the Earl of Desmond, and having
the reputation of being a skilful soldier. He had
already fought against the English in Ireland, but
had been beaten by them, and compelled to sue for
peace.</p>

<p>Beside him there stood three or four priests, and,
a little way off, a group of men wearing armour, their
swords shining brightly in their hands. There was
also a goodly muster of footmen, having arquebuses,
spears and other weapons. And my heart warmed
when I beheld this array.</p>

<p>Quitting my galley, I went on board of the ship,
and presently had told Fitzmaurice, who evidently
was the leader of the expedition, who I was, and
for what purpose I was come. I also delivered to
him letters which de Vilela and de Ricaldo had
given me for him. Having read these over very
carefully, he began to ply me eagerly with many
questions.</p>

<p>Was Desmond well? What preparations had he
made to rise against the English? What was the
general state of the country? Did its princes and
chiefs know that he was coming, and were they ready
to drive the English into the sea? Were the English
in force, and where lay their army? Who was there
now at Limerick?</p>

<p>All these and many other things did he inquire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
me, listening to my replies with the closest attention,
comparing what I said with what was written in the
letters I had brought, and making a commentary of
his own. But I soon found out that he was in reality
as well informed as I was.</p>

<p>Here was one, I said to myself, who was a very
different man from Desmond. The way he bore himself
was so instinct with firmness, courage and resolution
that he at once instilled a feeling of confidence
in all who met him. Then the questions he had
addressed to me impressed me as being just such
questions as a soldier and a man of action would
ask. But what struck me most was that when he
spoke of Desmond, while he said not a word in his
dispraise, he was apparently not certain of him. And
this was so much in my own manner of thinking of
the Earl that my fear of him was intensified.</p>

<p>It was now my turn to ask questions, and I inquired
how many men Fitzmaurice had with him,
and if these were all, or were we to look for more?</p>

<p>“There are four hundred of us&mdash;Spaniards,
Italians, Irish, and English; these English,” he
added, “are not of the Queen’s religion. And as
to what we may expect, Father Sanders will tell
you more,” and he turned to one of the priests
standing near. “Father,” said he to the priest,
“this is Ruari Macdonald, foster-brother of Grace
O’Malley of Erris and the Isles of Connaught.”</p>

<p>“You have just come from Desmond,” said
Sanders; “I have heard something of what you
have been saying, and your mistress is with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “Grace O’Malley is at Askeaton.”</p>

<p>“She is firm in the cause?”</p>

<p>“She, and all of us, are proclaimed rebels,” cried
I, “so you may judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>Then he exchanged glances with Fitzmaurice,
and continued, “And Desmond? what of him?”</p>

<p>Thereupon I gave them an account of what had
occurred at Askeaton since our arrival there.</p>

<p>“I do not see,” said Sanders, when I had done,
“how the Earl could have acted otherwise. As he
said, he had to wait till the time was ripe. But
now, the time is ripe, and the Desmond war-cry
will soon resound on every side!” And the
priest looked fixedly at Fitzmaurice, who, however,
remained silent.</p>

<p>Sanders then began speaking again, and told me
how that the Pope had blessed the expedition, and
had given both men and money, and would send
more ere long. Next he took me to see a splendid
banner, all blue and gold, with the figure of our Lord
upon it, which he had received from Rome.</p>

<p>“This will march with our hosts,” cried he, “and
lead us on to victory!”</p>

<p>Now, with the priests and the mysteries of religion
I have never had much to do, and while the spirit of
the man was in itself a beautiful thing, and the
banner, too, a thing beautiful to behold, yet I could
not forbear from thinking that fighting men were
what we most stood in need of, and that four hundred
soldiers, however brave they were, even added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to our own, were far from being sufficient to drive
the English out of Ireland. For I knew the English
by this time, and that they were no mean foes.</p>

<p>And when I said what was in my mind to Fitzmaurice,
who I was sure would agree with me, he
replied that I must remember that the force he had
with him was but the advance guard of a great
army, which, even at that very instant, might be
already on its way to our coasts. So I took fresh
courage, and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>After we had had a long conversation I said that
my present business was to see his ships safe into
the harbour of Dingle, or into any other haven which
might be selected in Kerry, and as de Ricaldo’s
vessel was not at Dingle, I purposed, if it was agreeable
to him, to go on ahead in my galley and show
him the way, as it were, to the place. To this he
assented, and I went back to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>.
We made Dingle soon thereafter, and I could see
that Fitzmaurice and Sanders immediately got ready
to land.</p>

<p>There had already gathered upon the shore a
crowd of the Irish belonging to that part of Kerry.
Partly, I imagine, to impress them, and partly
because of the nature of the occasion itself, Fitzmaurice
and Sanders had deemed that their landing
afforded a fit opportunity for no little display. They
had therefore arranged a sort of procession, and I
watched it, as it moved along, with keen interest;
nor was I cold and stolid myself at the sight
of the joy of the country people, who received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
it on shore with loud shoutings and a tumult of
cheers.</p>

<p>Two friars, chanting a psalm, stepped first on
shore; behind them came a bishop, clad in the
robes of his sacred office, with a mitre on his head
and a pastoral staff in his left hand. His right hand
was raised solemnly invoking a blessing on the land,
and his lips moved as if in prayer, while the Irish
knelt upon the shore as his feet touched the ground.</p>

<p>Then came Father Sanders, the banner which the
Pope had consecrated waving above him, and, immediately
after him, Fitzmaurice and those of
knightly rank&mdash;gallant, mailed, long-sworded gentlemen
every one! And now the foot-soldiers, each
in a company under its own captain, streamed from
the ships&mdash;making altogether a brave show.</p>

<p>As soon as a camping place for the night had
been chosen, Fitzmaurice appeared at the side of
my galley, and, having come on board, said that
the harbour of Dingle from its shape&mdash;the mouth
of the bay being narrow&mdash;was one from which it
would be difficult to escape in an extremity, and
asked me to suggest another.</p>

<p>Whereupon I replied that the haven of Smerwick,
four miles to the north across the tongue of land
where we now were, would be more to his mind.
And thither the next day Fitzmaurice marched his
troops; the ships were brought round, and, all his
stores having been fetched ashore, he at once set
his men to work, making a trench and fortifying
the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>As I had now accomplished the mission my
mistress had entrusted me with, I set about preparing
to return to Askeaton. But Fitzmaurice
prevailed upon me to stay two or three days longer,
telling me he had sent horsemen to Desmond with
a letter, in which he had urged his kinsman to declare
war against the Queen without delay, and saying the
reply might be of such a character as to change my
plans. He hoped the answer would be speedy, and in
any case, he said, it was well that I should know
exactly what the Earl wrote.</p>

<p>But several days passed, and still no word came
from Desmond.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir John, a brother of the Earl,
arrived at Smerwick. This man, with whom a hatred
of the English was the chief passion of his life, greatly
lamented the supineness of his brother, but he had
no knowledge of the Earl’s movements. There was
no mistaking that Sir John was sincere, and when he
asked Fitzmaurice, de Vilela, and myself to accompany
him on his return to his castle of Tralee,
where, he said, our reception would give full proof
of his devotion to the cause, I for one gladly
assented.</p>

<p>We took with us a considerable number of men,
so as to guard against a surprise, but we reached
Tralee without adventure of any sort.</p>

<p>Before we had gained the castle itself, however,
we were met by one of Sir John’s gallowglasses, who
warned him that two officers of the English had
arrived there that very day, and that, as one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
was well known to Sir John, they had been allowed
to enter within its walls without question.</p>

<p>Hastily calling a halt, we consulted together what
was the wisest course to pursue. Sir John was for
our going on, but Fitzmaurice thought it would be
more prudent for Sir John to ride forward with his
own attendants, and then, when night had fallen, we
might secretly enter the castle.</p>

<p>“Who are the Englishmen?” asked I, thinking
that they might be known to me.</p>

<p>“One is Carter, the Marshal of Munster,” replied
Sir John, “and the other is Davell, a captain in the
garrison at Limerick.”</p>

<p>I was acquainted with neither, but I remembered
that I had heard of Davell, and what it was, and
I looked steadily at Sir John.</p>

<p>“Sir John,” said I, “the name of Davell is not
unfamiliar to me, and, if my memory serve me aright,
you must know him well.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he shortly; “he once stood between
me and death in a former war. But what of that,”
added he grimly, “as things are now?”</p>

<p>I held my peace, whereupon he exclaimed
passionately: “I will suffer nothing to stand between
me and the deliverance of Ireland! Let us proceed.”</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice, however, would not agree to this;
so Sir John went on, as had been suggested, and we
withdrew into the forest not far from the castle.
But about midnight Sir John sent to say that the
Englishmen had gone to bed, and that, as all was now
quiet, he invited us to come. Nor did we refuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had entered within the silent castle, Sir
John met us, and led us, who were leaders, into the
hall, but our men lay down in the courtyard. When
wine and meat had been put before us, the waiting-men
going about on tiptoe, Fitzmaurice inquired
of Sir John if we might be told on what business
it was that Carter and Davell had come to Tralee.</p>

<p>“As spies. What else?” said Sir John. “The
tidings of your landing have reached the ears of the
President, and they have ventured hither for more
news. They tell me they wish to see for themselves
what is going on.”</p>

<p>“What say they of Desmond?” I asked.</p>

<p>“They say&mdash;what I cannot believe,” cried he,
forgetting to whisper, as we had been doing; “they
say that Desmond himself sent a letter to the President&mdash;a
letter he had received from you,” and here
he glanced at Fitzmaurice&mdash;”and that he has offered
to drive the Spaniards back to their ships.”</p>

<p>We were all silent. As for me, my mind was
as a blank, while my heart beat so furiously that
it was like to rend my body.</p>

<p>“I will never believe it,” said Sir John. “’Tis
nothing but a base lie!”</p>

<p>In the anguish of my spirit I groaned aloud, so
that the rest looked curiously at me.</p>

<p>“You believe it!” slowly said Fitzmaurice; “and,
by the Mass! so do I.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed Sir John. “Not that&mdash;not
that!”</p>

<p>Then he sprang from his place, and, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the dim light of the candles, I could not but see
how ghastly was his face.</p>

<p>“Not that&mdash;not that!” he cried again, then with
swift steps turned and left us.</p>

<p>I heard the sound of his feet as he went up
the stair to the sleeping-rooms above; presently the
noise ceased, but in another moment the stillness
was rent by a piercing cry, quickly followed by
another and another.</p>

<p>We gazed at each other fearfully, asking mutely
what this might portend, when Sir John returned
to the hall, his mantle and his hands stained with
blood.</p>

<p>“Let this,” cried he in wild accents, and he
shivered as the blood dripped from him, “let this be
a pledge of the faithfulness of the Desmonds to
you and to the cause!”</p>

<p>“What have you done?” asked Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>“There are no English spies alive now in Tralee,”
said he more calmly, “to carry tales to Limerick.”</p>

<p>He had stabbed to death Carter and Davell, as
they lay asleep, with his own dagger.</p>

<p>And one of them had saved his life, and both had
counted themselves his friends!</p>

<p>I felt myself growing sick with horror of the man
and his deed. To slay men in a fight was one
thing, but to kill sleeping men under one’s own roof
was another and a very different thing.</p>

<p>And with the horror there came a nameless fear.</p>

<small>SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS.</small></h2>


<p>Once the first shock of this terrible affair was over
my thoughts were so many, and withal so dreary,
that it was impossible for me to get any sleep in
the short hours which yet remained before the day
dawned.</p>

<p>I sought and found excuses for Sir John, but
the excuses did not wholly satisfy me. For, if
against this act of treachery of his, there might and
could be set instances as base on the part of the
English rulers of Ireland, that made it not the less
foul.</p>

<p>He no doubt justified himself in his own sight
by believing he had committed his brother, the
Earl, irrevocably to the cause, and that now all his
hesitation must cease. But would it? I asked myself.</p>

<p>Carter and Davell had declared that Desmond
was in communication with the President of Munster;
no sooner had I heard this than I felt it
must be true. So, too, had said Fitzmaurice.
And if it were, in what position, then, was Grace
O’Malley?</p>

<p>After all, was it true?</p>

<p>Sir John had denied it; but had it not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the very fear that it was true, which had driven
him as by a sort of frenzy into this dark and
dreadful act of slaying his defenceless guests?</p>

<p>And if Desmond were a traitor, where and in
what case was my mistress?</p>

<p>And what of Eva?</p>

<p>One thing was clear, and that was that Tralee
was no place for me. I now regretted deeply that
I had not returned to Askeaton at once after the
harbour of Smerwick had been chosen by the
Spaniards, and determined to get back to <i>The Cross
of Blood</i> and to set out for the stronghold of
Desmond immediately, for it was there that I
should be.</p>

<p>With the first blush of day I roused up my
own men, and bade them be ready to march. As
I was standing among them in the yard, both
Fitzmaurice and de Vilela approached, and beckoned
to me to join them. As I came up, a dozen horsemen
or more swept past us, and fled across the
bridge.</p>

<p>“There goes the rising of Munster,” cried Fitzmaurice
joyfully, nodding towards the horsemen.
“They have been charged with messages to all the
chiefs of the province, and before night has fallen
the battle-cry of the Desmonds will have been
sounded forth throughout the whole territories of
the Geraldines.”</p>

<p>“You have heard, then, from Desmond?” asked
I, greatly relieved by his words.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied he; “but, after last night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Desmond can have no choice. Surely you must
agree with me in that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, very slowly. “I am not sure that
I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“Which means you do not!” cried he, with
anger in his tones. “But why?”</p>

<p>It was not easy to put what I thought into so
many words, and I did not answer at once.</p>

<p>“Why? why?” again asked Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>“I can hardly tell you,” replied I; “but you
heard, as well as I did, the report of his dealings
with the President, and”&mdash;here I spoke out quite
bluntly&mdash;”I have no firm faith in Desmond.”</p>

<p>“Perchance, he hesitated,” said Fitzmaurice,
“perhaps he did at the beginning; but all that
will now be at an end. He must declare himself
openly. His hand has been forced by Sir John,
and he cannot stand out against us and his people.”</p>

<p>“What are your plans now?” I asked, rather
wearily, for I was tired of this incessant reference
to Desmond.</p>

<p>“To wait at Tralee till I hear from him,” said
he. “You will wait also?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “I return to Smerwick to-day.”</p>

<p>“Return to Smerwick? I shall not let you!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said I, with some heat. “You are
not my commander, and I owe you no obedience.
It is not yours to say what I shall do; that is the
right of my mistress alone.”</p>

<p>“Your mistress!” said Fitzmaurice with a sneer.</p>

<p>My hand went to my sword, but de Vilela, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
had so far taken no part in the conversation,
interfered.</p>

<p>“Señor,” said he to Fitzmaurice sternly, “you
can mean no disrespect to the lady, Grace O’Malley;
she is my dear friend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Señor,” said I, interrupting him, “this affair
is mine.”</p>

<p>“Señor Ruari” said he, “had any offence been
intended, it would have been mine, too.”</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice, who quickly saw that he had made
a mistake, declared that he had neither said nor
implied anything to the despite of my mistress, but
his look was sullen, and I wondered at him.</p>

<p>It was apparent that he had something on his
mind that was not favourable to her, but he said
no more. It was possible that he had heard about
her in connection with Desmond, so I concluded,
and this urged me to the more haste in leaving
Tralee.</p>

<p>“I am going to Smerwick at once,” said I to them
both.</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice was about to speak, but, changing his
mind, walked away. De Vilela then asked me why I
was in so great a hurry to be gone.</p>

<p>“My place is with my mistress,” said I briefly, for
I could not tell him my thoughts.</p>

<p>“That is a true word,” said he; and there was a
strange catch in his voice, so that I looked at him
curiously, expecting him to say more, but he was
silent.</p>

<p>No objection being made to our departure, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
men and I left Tralee, and, before night had set in we
were at Smerwick. Having saluted the officers of
the Spanish ships, and acquainted them with my intention,
I weighed out from Smerwick the following
morning, and on the third day came up with <i>The
Grey Wolf</i> and <i>The Winged Horse</i>, which were
quietly riding at anchor in the bay, not far from the
castle of Askeaton.</p>

<p>Many had been the questionings of my spirit as
we had gone up the Shannon; many my doubts and
fears of I knew not quite what; but the mere sight of
the galleys, thus peacefully resting on the water like a
pair of great sea-birds, dispelled them at once.</p>

<p>Tibbot, who had been in chief command during
the absence of Grace O’Malley and myself, came on
board of <i>The Cross of Blood</i> as soon as we had let go
our anchor, and I could see from the very way he
carried himself that all was well with the ships. He
had nothing stirring to tell me, so it appeared, but
was exceedingly anxious to hear about the men from
Spain, and what was being done.</p>

<p>But before I had gratified him in this respect, I
inquired when he had last seen or had word of our
mistress, and he answered that she and the Earl of
Desmond and a numerous party had visited the
galleys a day or two after I had sailed down the
river; and that, since then, he had had no tidings
of her. Nothing, moreover, save vague rumours
of Fitzmaurice and the Spaniards had reached
him through the people living on the shore of the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as was known, Desmond still lay at
Askeaton, and had not joined in the rising against
the Queen.</p>

<p>Tibbot seemed sure that everything and everybody
remained at the castle in the same position as
when I had left it; but I resolved to go thither
without loss of time, and to see for myself how the
land lay.</p>

<p>I charged Tibbot in the meantime not to allow
our men to wander away, but to keep them, as far
as possible, in the galleys, and so to be prepared
for any emergency. And I enjoined upon him that
he was not to offer attack, but only to stand on his
defence in case of assault.</p>

<p>Having spoken in the same terms to Calvagh,
who was to act as Tibbot’s lieutenant, I took but
one attendant, thinking that if more went with me
I should not be able to get to Askeaton as quickly
as I wished.</p>

<p>It was not yet evening as I came in sight of
Askeaton, and as I gazed down upon it from the
high ground opposite, I noticed that there was
nothing unusual in its appearance, except that the
drawbridge was up, and that there were perhaps a
few more soldiers on the walls than was customary.
Descending the edge of the stream I shouted to the
watch, peering at me through the wicket, to open
the gate. I could not but have been well known to
them, but I was kept waiting for some minutes&mdash;at
which I marvelled much. I had no thought,
however, of turning back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, the chains of the drawbridge, as they
clashed and clattered through the sheaves, began to
move, and the bridge fell into place, the gate being
opened at the same instant.</p>

<p>What followed was so sudden that I have only a
confused recollection of it.</p>

<p>My feet had no more than trodden the creaking
planks of the drawbridge, as it seemed to me, or I
may have been just within the door, when I was set
upon by several of Desmond’s men.</p>

<p>I was taken completely off my guard, albeit I
struggled with all my strength, but, being at a disadvantage,
this availed me not a whit. In any case,
I must soon have been overpowered; but the matter
was the quicker settled by a blow on my head, under
which I went down like a felled ox.</p>

<p>When I had come somewhat to my senses again,
it was to find myself sick and giddy from the blow,
while my hands and feet were tightly bound with
ropes, so that my flesh was chafed and cut; there
had been a gag thrust into my mouth, and my eyes
were bandaged. I could not speak, nor see, nor
move. I could feel I was lying on the earth, but
where I was I knew not.</p>

<p>“He is coming to himself,” said a voice. My
brain was reeling, reeling, reeling; but there was that
in the voice that seemed not strange, yet I could not
remember whose it was, so far off was it&mdash;as if from
another world.</p>

<p>“Put him&mdash;&mdash;” and there were other words that
came to me, but so indistinctly that I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
make them out at all; nay, I could not tell, being
in a stupor, whether I was awake or did only dream.</p>

<p>Then I was taken up and carried along&mdash;up steps
and steps which appeared to be without end, and at
last was thrown upon a wooden floor. A door was
shut and bolted and barred; and thereafter a sound
of retreating footsteps dying away, and I was left
alone. I was wide awake now, for my body was one
great, almost insupportable pain.</p>

<p>And terrible as was the anguish of my frame, that
of my mind was more; but first came the racking of
the bones and the torture of the flesh, and these, in
their turn, brought consciousness and memory, and
an indescribable agony of the soul.</p>

<p>I tried to move&mdash;a thing well-nigh impossible to
me, trussed up as I was, and by reason also of the
pain I suffered; and I was constrained to abandon
the attempt. I should have borne up better perhaps
if my eyes had been open and my tongue free; but
there I lay in the darkness, like one already dead,
and had nearly given way to despair.</p>

<p>And as the shadows and mists of stupor cleared
away from my mind, I was overwhelmed at the
extent of the disaster which had befallen me, for I
saw in it but too surely an indication of some dreadful
evil, some fearful calamity which had overtaken
my mistress and her fortunes, and that, too, at the
hands of Desmond.</p>

<p>And I was powerless to help her! I had allowed
myself to be caught&mdash;running, blind fool that I was,
my own head into the noose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Where was she?</p>

<p>Where was Eva?</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>What was to be the end? Was this it?</p>

<p>Around such questions as these did my thoughts
move, as if in a circle; ever asking the same questions,
and ever without reply; until I felt that there
was no more than the breadth of a thread between
me and madness.</p>

<p>After a great while&mdash;how long I wist not, and
perchance it was no such great while as it seemed
to me in that wild fever of my spirit&mdash;the door of
the room in which I lay huddled upon the floor
was opened. I verily believe that it was the mere
opening of the door at that very moment that kept
me from becoming a maniac, so strained were those
fine chords which subtly hold mind and body as
if in a balance.</p>

<p>The bandage was untied from about my eyes,
and the gag was taken from my mouth; the ropes
were partly unloosened from my arms, and food and
water were placed beside me.</p>

<p>Two men were in the room, both bearing drawn
swords, and one carrying a lantern, for it was night,
and but for its light we had been in total darkness.
Yet so sore were my eyes that I could scarcely
bear to look at the men, and when I essayed to
speak I could not utter a word so swollen was my
tongue.</p>

<p>“Eat and drink,” said one of them; but I could do
no more than roll my head helplessly from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the other, seeing how foredone I was, put
the pitcher to my lips, and I drank, although each
mouthful I swallowed of the water was a fresh
torment. But with the blessed water there came
relief, nay, life itself, for the frenzy died out of my
brain, and my mind became calm and clear. Thereafter
I ate, and essayed to speak with the two men,
but they had evidently been forbidden to converse
with me, for they would answer nothing. After a
short time they withdrew, bolting and barring the
door behind them, and I was left to myself.</p>

<p>Hours dragged slowly by, and, at length, the
sleep of exhaustion fell upon me, and when I awoke
it was broad daylight. The repose had restored me
in a great measure to myself; but the stinging of
the cuts made by the bonds on my legs and arms,
and the dull throbbing, throbbing of my head,
quickly recalled me to the misery of my situation.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, I was released from
the ropes, and more food and water were brought
me. Again I endeavoured to get the men, who I
perceived were the same that had come to me the
previous evening, to speak to me, but in vain.</p>

<p>Before they had made their appearance I had
seen that I had not been cast into one of the
dungeons of Askeaton, but was imprisoned in a
chamber which I judged, numbering the steps up
which I had been borne, to be at the top of one of
the towers of the castle. As soon as they had gone
I set about examining the room, albeit I was so
stiff and sore that at first I could only crawl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
creep on the floor. As this exercise, however, gave
me back the use of my limbs, I was soon able to
stand and move about with ease.</p>

<p>The room was small and bare, without even a
stool or a bench, and was lighted by a little, narrow
window, from which I caught glimpses of distant
masses of trees and the slopes and peaks of far-off
mountains. During my first visit to Desmond, I
had made myself familiar with every part of the
castle, and I knew that the surmise I had made
that the room was high up in a tower was a true
one.</p>

<p>There were only the two ways of getting out, the
one by the door, the other by the window. The
door was firmly secured, for I had tried it, but I
might as well have sought to move the stone walls
of the chamber. And the window was many feet
above the ground or the river, so that it was impossible
to escape by it, unless by means of a ladder
or a rope, neither of which I possessed.</p>

<p>It therefore required very little reflection on my
part to understand how complete was my captivity,
and how small was the chance of my being able to
deliver myself from it.</p>

<p>But it was something that I could see, that I
could breathe freely, and that I could speak aloud,
and hear, at least, the sound of my own voice. And
these somehow brought with them a faint ray of
hope. As I paced up and down the room&mdash;that I
was permitted to go without chains showed in itself
how convinced my gaolers were that I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
break free&mdash;I determined not to despair. But as
the day passed wretchedly by, and night came on
again, it was difficult to keep any degree of firmness
in my heart.</p>

<p>A thing which kept constantly recurring to me
was the haunting recollection of the voice I had
heard, or fancied that I had heard, after I had been
struck down, and was half-alive and half-dead, and
so certain of nothing. Then, knowing, as I well did,
what was the usual horrible fate of one taken
prisoner, I could not but ponder with surprise the
comparative tenderness shown me.</p>

<p>I had not been thrown into a noisome cell
beneath the castle, or, what would have been worse
still, under the bed of the stream, and left to die
of madness and hunger, a prey to rats and other
vermin.</p>

<p>Nay, I asked myself why I had not been slain
outright? That, it was manifest, had not been the
purpose of those who had set upon me, for, once I
was down, nothing could have been easier than to
despatch me.</p>

<p>Then, whose voice was it that I had heard? For
the life of me I could not remember.</p>

<p>When evening was come, food and water were
provided as before, but in the same obduracy of
silence. The men were as speechless as mutes,
beyond one saying, “Eat and drink,” and I was
strangely glad and even moved to hear these simple
words.</p>

<p>Once more being left to the solitude of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
prison-chamber, a thought came, sharply shooting
like an arrow, through my sombre musings. The
same two men always appeared with the food; just
two men, I told myself, <i>against one</i>. True, they
were armed, and I was not; but might not a quick,
dexterous, unexpected assault give me my opportunity?
And if I could but get out of the room,
could I not trust to my star, and to my knowledge
of the castle, to find some way of escape? And if
I failed? Well, the worst was death, and I had
faced it before. And so the project grew, and took
a firm hold of me.</p>

<p>Not thus, however, had it been ordained.</p>

<p>So agitated was I by the mere prospect of regaining
my liberty, that it was long ere I went to
sleep, and then methought I dreamed a happy dream.</p>

<p>There was, as it were, a light in that mean room&mdash;not
a great brightness, but a dimly burning light,
itself a shadow among other shadows. And behind
that shadow, a pale presence and a ghostly, stood
Eva O’Malley, and by her side a muffled figure,
vague and indistinct, but seen darkly as in a mirror
over which the breath has passed. Clearer, and yet
more clearly, there were bodied forth the face and
form I knew and loved; her hand touched me, and
my name was whispered softly in my ear.</p>

<p>“Ruari! Ruari!”</p>

<p>I heard the rustle of her garments; then the
shadow danced along the wall and died away, as the
light came closer to my face.</p>

<p>“Ruari! Ruari!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>“O my love! my love!” cried I.</p>

<p>“Ruari! Ruari! Come!” said she.</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush!” said the muffled figure, and
all at once I was aware that this was no dream, but
a verity.</p>

<p>This was no other than my dear herself.</p>

<p>And the muffled figure&mdash;who was that? A man’s
voice surely had I heard say “Hush!” And why
were they come? Wherefore, indeed, but to deliver
me. And I sprang up from the floor in haste.</p>

<p>“Softly, softly,” said Eva, as I clasped her hand&mdash;a
living hand, thank God!</p>

<p>Then she whispered low that for the present they
must leave me, for if we all went together, the suspicion
of the guards might be aroused, but that I
must find my way out as best I could. Her words
bewildered me, but there was no time for explanations,
which would come afterwards.</p>

<p>“You must contrive to get down by yourself to
the court,” said she. “We will meet you there, but
wait here first for about an hour, then start. You
will find the door of this room open; take the left
turn, and make no noise or you will be lost.”</p>

<p>I did as I had been bid. After what I supposed
might be an hour I felt my way out of the room, and
stepping slowly and with a cat’s wariness succeeded,
but with many quakings and alarms, in reaching the
great hall without attracting the attention of anyone.
Never could I have done this had I not been familiar
with the castle, and even as it was I had frequently
to stop perplexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>In the hall were many men asleep, each with his
weapon by him, as I could see, though uncertainly,
from the dull glow of the embers on the wide hearth.
Near the fire itself sat two men, and for awhile I
looked at them fearfully, for past them must I go.
But as I watched them carefully I saw their heads
nodding, nodding&mdash;they, too, were asleep.</p>

<p>Out through the slumberers did I step, praying
dumbly that they might not waken through any slip
of mine, and, reaching the door in safety, was, in
another moment, in the court.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>THE PERFIDY OF DESMOND.</small></h2>


<p>“Ruari!” said Eva O’Malley; “here!”</p>

<p>It was that darkest time of night that preludes
the day, and I could see no one with any degree of
clearness, but, guided by that beloved voice, I went
forward, nothing doubting.</p>

<p>Straining my eyes into the blank, I made out
figures, moving towards the gate; Eva came to my
side, and we followed close upon them. Mystified as
I was at what had just occurred, it gave me a
delicious thrill of happiness to be near Eva, and to
feel myself a free man again.</p>

<p>“Eva!” I said.</p>

<p>“Do not speak&mdash;do not speak,” said she, “we are
not yet out of danger.”</p>

<p>In silence then we walked through the court until
we had come to the guard-house by the gate, and
there we halted. One of those with us went into the
room, and I could hear, though indistinctly, the
sounds of him and others talking together.</p>

<p>Some long minutes passed, and the suspense was
becoming unendurable, when two men with lanterns
appeared. Without looking at us they proceeded to
lower the drawbridge, the rattling of whose chains
was to me then the finest music in the world, and
to open the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quick,” said Eva to me, pushing me gently on.</p>

<p>I was over the bridge and on the further side in a
flash along with two others; turning back I heard an
exclamation from the watchmen with the lanterns,
and some expostulations.</p>

<p>“’Twas not in the bargain,” I caught; then there
were more words which I heard too imperfectly to
understand, but I recognised from the mere tone of
one of the voices who the speaker was.</p>

<p>And with this there dawned on me also whose was
the voice I had heard after I had been struck down.
It was Dermot Fitzgerald’s! And he it was who was
our guide!</p>

<p>In what way he satisfied the watchmen I do not
know, but, having done so, he and Eva crossed the
bridge. Then there was a whistle, and now a horse
neighed; and thereafter the trampling of chargers
broke upon the ear. The horse-boys brought the
animals up to us, and presently we were in the saddle,
moving off from the castle notwithstanding the
gloom, Fitzgerald leading the way.</p>

<p>I wondered where we were going, but I had been
told not to utter a word, in the one brief sentence I
had exchanged with Eva when we were mounting the
horses, and I followed on after her as I would have
done to the end of the world, but I was fair dazed
with these strange, fantastic tricks of fortune.</p>

<p>We had gone about a couple of leagues, as I conjectured,
from Askeaton, riding for the greater part
of the distance through the forest, when Fitzgerald
stopped&mdash;and so did we all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>The darkness had grown perceptibly less intense,
and we could now see a sort of path among the trees.</p>

<p>“I have done what I promised you,” said Fitzgerald
to Eva O’Malley. Then he turned towards me.
“Ruari Macdonald,” said he, “my debts to you are
also paid. Farewell, and God help and pity us all!”</p>

<p>“Dermot!” cried I.</p>

<p>But he was already past me, galloping fast and
furiously, like one hotly pursued.</p>

<p>“He has gone,” said Eva, and there was a sob in
her voice.</p>

<p>In an instant I had leaped from the saddle, and
was by her side. Her form was bowed forward upon
her horse’s neck, and her tears were falling heavily,
as I placed my arm about her waist, and drew her
towards me, heedless of those who were with us.</p>

<p>“Eva, darling,” I said. “What does all this
mean?” Not that I cared to be told at that
moment; it was enough that we were together. I
pressed her to my heart, and kissed away her tears
while she struggled with her emotions. I spoke
many words of endearment, and after awhile she
regained her calmness.</p>

<p>“Let us ride on,” she said at length.</p>

<p>“But whither are we going?” asked I.</p>

<p>“To the camp of Richard Burke,” she replied;
“it is only three or four miles ahead of us&mdash;so
Dermot Fitzgerald said. And he has shown himself
our friend after all.”</p>

<p>“To Richard Burke?” cried I, more amazed, if
that were possible, even than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have patience, Ruari” said she, “you must soon
know everything; but be patient&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Our mistress?” asked I, at no time very patient,
and now devoured with questions.</p>

<p>“Wait a little, wait a little,” said she, and she
broke into weeping again, so that my heart smote me
at the sight of her grief. But when I would have
taken her in my arms again to try to comfort her,
she waved me off, and, shaking up her horse, rode
on in front.</p>

<p>The day breaking clearly as we went along, I
observed that those behind me were two women of my
mistress’s and Eva’s, and the man I had brought with
me from <i>The Cross of Blood</i> to Askeaton. My mind
was now in such a tangle that I had to resign myself
passively, and to become, as it were, rather a spectator
of than a participator in what was going on.</p>

<p>In truth, I felt more at sea than ever before in my
life, and was even inclined to prick myself, like a
boy, to see if we were indeed living, or merely moving
in some spectral land of shades and phantoms.</p>

<p>Nor did this air of unreality wear away until we
had arrived at the camp of the Burkes. But as we
emerged from the trees into the open, we were at
once recognised by those on guard, for they had seen
both Eva and myself frequently in the galleys, and
thus we were well known to them.</p>

<p>They raised so loud and fervent a shout of
welcome that the MacWilliam quickly appeared on
the ground to ascertain what was happening. He
gazed at us like one sorely puzzled; then, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
came forward to greet us, there was an expression
of alarm.</p>

<p>“Eva O’Malley!” he exclaimed. Then he came
up to me, and as I held out my hand he gasped
with astonishment, for my hands were bleeding from
the unhealed cuts inflicted by the ropes with which I
had been tied, my dress was in disorder, and my feet,
which were bare, were spattered with blood.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” cried he hoarsely.
“Where is your mistress? What? What?”</p>

<p>“Fetch wine,” said I, partly to divert his thoughts,
partly because it seemed as if Eva were about to
swoon. “Go, fetch us wine!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” said Eva faintly. Then, with an
effort of the will, she added, “I will tell you everything&mdash;when
I have recovered a little.”</p>

<p>Leading us to his tent, he called for wine, and
when Eva and I had drunk, and our attendants also,
she and the MacWilliam and I were left by ourselves,
all the others being told to withdraw.</p>

<p>“Have you heard?” she asked, looking at Burke.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied he, “save that the Spaniards
are come. The messenger Ruari sent told me that
de Ricaldo had arrived at Askeaton, and I have since
heard that their ships lie at Smerwick.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more?” asked Eva.</p>

<p>And he shook his head.</p>

<p>“I hardly am less in the dark than yourself,” said
I. “All that I know besides is that when I returned
to Askeaton from Smerwick no more than two days
ago, I was set upon in entering the castle, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>powered,
knocked senseless, bound, and made a
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Made a prisoner!” cried Richard Burke. “God’s
wounds! And why?”</p>

<p>“That I as yet know not,” I answered. “But Eva
will perhaps inform us; this very night did she and
Fitzgerald deliver me out of Askeaton.”</p>

<p>Richard Burke gazed from one to the other of us,
too much astonished to speak. I looked at Eva,
whose eyes were sad and weary, but the colour was
in her cheeks and her lips trembled only a very little.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she, “I can tell you; but let me begin
at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“More wine?” said I, and she took a sip from the
goblet I handed to her.</p>

<p>“I am tired,” said she, with a moan like that
of a hurt child; “but you must know all, and that
quickly. You remember the night in which Juan
de Ricaldo reached Askeaton?” asked she of me.</p>

<p>“I left some hours later that very night,” I
replied, “to meet the Spanish ships.”</p>

<p>“You remember also that two of the justices
of Munster had come from Limerick with a letter
from the President demanding that Grace O’Malley
should be sent to him, so that he could cast her into
prison?”</p>

<p>“I had not heard of that!” exclaimed Burke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said; “I well remember it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how am I to tell it!” said Eva piteously,
and I bled for her in all my veins. “But say on
I must. Perchance,” continued she, speaking to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
again, “you observed that Garrett Desmond was
infatuated with her, and that she did not rebuke
him as she might have done?”</p>

<p>“It was to keep stiff that weak back of his,” said
I, “and to get him to declare boldly against the
Queen.”</p>

<p>Richard Burke’s face was like a black cloud, and
a groan, deep and terrible, came from his lips.</p>

<p>“That was it,” said Eva. “Do I not know that
it was?” said she to Burke. “Ay, well do I know
it. And Desmond, too, knows it now.”</p>

<p>“Desmond knows!” cried Burke more cheerfully,
and he looked almost happy. This was not my case.
What horrible thing was coming? I asked myself,
for that something horrible had taken place I had no
doubt whatever, and my spirits sank like a stone.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Eva. “Desmond sent back the two
justices empty-handed to the President, but what he
bade them tell him I cannot say. When they departed
I noted their demeanour, and it was not that
altogether of men who were wholly dissatisfied with
the issue of their mission. Even then,” cried she,
with a fierceness the like of which was never seen
in her before, “I believe he meditated treachery.”</p>

<p>“Treachery! A Desmond a traitor!” said Burke,
upon whose countenance the cloud had come back,
for the drift of Eva’s words was clear enough.</p>

<p>“No sign, however,” said she, “did the Earl show
of anything of the kind. Never was he gayer than
during the next few days, and I hoped that all was
as fair for Grace O’Malley’s plans as it seemed. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
days after you had gone, Ruari, he and his chief men
and our mistress and myself, with a great host of
attendants, went down the stream from the castle,
and made a visit to the two galleys lying in the bay.”</p>

<p>“Tibbot told me of it,” said I.</p>

<p>“Desmond had a purpose in it,” said Eva, “as
I can see now. He wished to show Tibbot his friendship
for our mistress, and never after that manifestation
of it would Tibbot suspect, he thought, that
there would be aught amiss with her at Askeaton
in so long as she was with him.”</p>

<p>“A shrewd trick,” said I bitterly.</p>

<p>“What has taken place? Where is Grace
O’Malley?” cried Burke, restless, troubled, tortured
even.</p>

<p>“I know not where she is,” said Eva slowly, while
the tears gathered in her eyes. “I know not.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried he.</p>

<p>“Patience,” urged I, myself consumed with impatience,
anger, and a multitude of terrible passions.</p>

<p>“Let me go on,” said Eva, with a choke. “It was
shortly after we had returned from the ships,” continued
she bravely&mdash;”three or four days perhaps&mdash;when
there was a great stir at the castle, for messengers
had come with tidings of the landing of the
Spaniards. A letter, too, they brought from Sir James
Fitzmaurice, who was in command, as it appeared, of
the expedition. I questioned one of the messengers,”
said Eva shyly, “if he had seen you, Ruari, and he
told me that he had.”</p>

<p>I secretly blessed my dear for this reference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
me, but as I did not desire to interrupt her story
I kept silence.</p>

<p>“We were all in good heart,” said she, “by reason
of the coming of the men from Spain, and Grace
O’Malley in particular rejoiced exceedingly. Desmond
himself, however, was strangely quiet. Then that
night&mdash;How can I tell you?” and she broke down
utterly and wept aloud.</p>

<p>Burke’s eyes were full of fright, but mine too
brimmed over when I looked at my dear and saw
her shaken with sobs. And I wept also, nor am I
ashamed of these tears of sympathy.</p>

<p>“’Tis no time to weep,” said she after a pause, and
resumed her tale, but in broken accents. “That
night, as we were retiring to sleep, I observed that
Grace O’Malley had lost all her gaiety and brightness,
and was in some great distress of mind. I implored
her not to withhold her confidence from me, and
to tell me what was her trouble.</p>

<p>“Then it appeared that Desmond had read to her
the letter of Fitzmaurice, and, when she had heard it
to the end, declared that he had placed his whole
future in her hands, as he loved her passionately and
could not live without her. If she would consent to
become his wife, it would be a very easy matter to get
a divorce from the countess, and thereafter they
would be married.”</p>

<p>“His wife!” ejaculated Burke.</p>

<p>“If she agreed, he said, to this proposal,” continued
Eva, “she might do with him and all the
Geraldines as she had a mind, and he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
immediately put himself at the head of the rebellion
against the Queen, if that was her wish.”</p>

<p>Richard Burke, unable to control his feelings any
longer, jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“What was her reply?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Wait&mdash;wait for another moment,” entreated Eva.</p>

<p>“Patience,” urged I once more, though God knows
I had no stock of it myself.</p>

<p>“If she refused&mdash;&mdash;” said Eva.</p>

<p>“She did refuse,” cried Burke.</p>

<p>“If she refused,” continued Eva, “to become his
wife, then not only would he not join with the
Spaniards, but he would aid the English against
them. When she pointed out to him that he had
compromised himself both by his intercourse with
Spain and with Fitzmaurice, and also by harbouring
herself, a proclaimed rebel, he hinted&mdash;for at first
he would not put his thoughts into so many words&mdash;that
he knew of a way in which he might very
readily make his peace with the President of Munster,
and that was by sending to him a pledge of his
fidelity to the Queen, which he was well informed
would be acceptable to him and to her Highness.”</p>

<p>“Fidelity to the Queen!” exclaimed I, glowing
with wrath.</p>

<p>Any child could have foreseen what was coming.
My mistress had indeed played with fire, and it
needed no wizard to tell me that she had been
scorched by its flames.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley,” Eva went on, not heeding my
interruption, “did not fail to understand his meaning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
She herself was the pledge of his fidelity to which he
had referred. She must give herself to him, or he
would betray her to the English; that, and not
obscurely, was the threat he made&mdash;that, and nothing
else. And she knew that she was in his power.”</p>

<p>“Horrible, horrible!” said Burke in anguish.</p>

<p>“Desmond,” said Eva, “strove, however, to conceal
the trap under the cloak of an appeal to her
devotion to the cause. She had only to say the word,
and the standards of the Geraldines would be arrayed
against the Queen, and then, with the English so
unprepared as they were, success was certain. It
rested with her. Hers was it to bid him go or stay.”</p>

<p>It was a strong temptation, I thought, but I was
too overcome to speak.</p>

<p>“Then,” continued Eva, “he sought to inflame
her ambition. As his wife, suggested he, might she
not become not only Countess of Desmond and the
greatest lady in the south, but even Queen of
Ireland, once the English had been driven out of
the country?”</p>

<p>Another strong temptation, thought I.</p>

<p>Desmond had certainly played his cards adroitly
enough. He had sought to touch her through her
hatred of the English, her love for her country, and
her ambition&mdash;all powerful forces. Women had
sacrificed themselves, nay, had willingly given themselves,
for less. And I could well understand
that to a soul like hers self-sacrifice was very
possible.</p>

<p>“But even,” said Eva, “in the background of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
his speaking, there lurked, like an evil beast, that
hint of what he would do, if she refused to submit
herself to him.”</p>

<p>After all, I said to myself, Desmond was a fool,
for that was the worst way to address a woman who
had the spirit of my mistress.</p>

<p>“To gain a little time, perhaps to escape from
Askeaton,” continued Eva, “Grace O’Malley asked to
be allowed the night to consider what he had said.
And to this he agreed, saying roughly, however, as
they parted, that she must have her answer ready for
him in the morning, and that there must be an end
to trifling. All this she told me, and then we sought
some way of escape, but Desmond had taken good
care that there should be none, for we soon found
that we were prisoners.”</p>

<p>“She had no intention of consenting to Desmond,”
said Burke, and his voice was full of pride
and joy.</p>

<p>“No,” said Eva, looking at him with kind eyes,
notwithstanding the grief in which she was.</p>

<p>“Go on, go on,” urged I, half vexed with them
both.</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Eva, “what was said or done
when the morning came, but I have not even seen
her since.” And her tears fell fast again, while
Burke and I were smitten into a gloomy silence.</p>

<p>“Have you heard nothing of her?” asked I, at
length.</p>

<p>“One of my women&mdash;she is here now&mdash;found out
that Desmond had taken her to one of his castles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
nearer to Limerick than Askeaton is, with what object
may be easily guessed.”</p>

<p>Burke started up madly.</p>

<p>“What is to be done? What is to be done?” cried he.</p>

<p>“A moment!” said I, and I turned to Eva.
“There is more to tell, is there not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied she. “After Grace O’Malley had
been carried away I was given a certain liberty, for
I was permitted to move about a part of the castle,
although I was always watched. One day I chanced
to see Dermot Fitzgerald, and though he tried to
avoid me as soon as he perceived me, I ran up
to him and caught him by the arm. I begged and
entreated him by our old friendship to tell me
what had become of our mistress, and what was
going on.</p>

<p>“When he would not answer, I went on my
knees,” said my dear, bravely, looking at me, “and
reminding him of what I had done for him when
he lay wounded, and of what Grace O’Malley had
done both for him and de Vilela, besought him to
have some pity on me, a woman.”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on!” said I hoarsely.</p>

<p>“He was so far moved,” said Eva, “as to tell
me that my mistress was well, and that no hurt
would be done me. Not that I thought about
myself. I saw him again once or twice, and besought
him to find some means by which I might
communicate with Grace O’Malley, but he said that
was impossible. Then I implored him to set me
free, but that, too, he said was not in his power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Eva stopped speaking; then she began again, her
voice strangely soft and tender.</p>

<p>“I saw you, Ruari, carried up the stairs two days
ago&mdash;bound, bleeding, almost dead as it seemed, and
Fitzgerald was along with the men who bore you in
their arms. Later that evening I saw him, and
anxiously asked what had occurred. I now perceived
that he was unhappy, like one burdened with remorse.</p>

<p>“Then he said that you had come to the castle
unexpectedly, and that, while it was deemed necessary
to make you a prisoner, no violence had been intended
towards you. He declared that he would give all the
world if only it would put our affairs right again; indeed,
he was like one gone clean mad with trouble, exclaiming
that he was the cause of all our woes!”</p>

<p>“The cause of all our woes!” cried I.</p>

<p>“You remember Mistress Sabina Lynch, Ruari,”
said Eva. “She it was, said he, who had told the
President of Munster to demand Grace O’Malley as
a pledge from Desmond of his loyalty to the Queen,
and it was through him&mdash;for he loves this woman&mdash;that
she knew our mistress was at Askeaton, though
he had never meant to betray her.”</p>

<p>Verily, as I said before, if I failed in my duty
when I suffered Sabina Lynch to live, I was
grievously punished for it.</p>

<p>“Yet not so does it appear to me,” said Eva,
as if she had seen into my heart! “For Desmond
is Desmond&mdash;a mass of treachery, a thing, a beast!
But when I saw how Dermot Fitzgerald felt about
the matter, I implored him to try to set you, Ruari,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
at least, at liberty. And he was the more ready to
listen to me because of this very Sabina Lynch, for,
said he, she owed her life to you, and he wished to
pay back the debt for this woman, whom he loves.”</p>

<p>Richard Burke kept muttering to himself, repeating,
as I thought, “Sabina Lynch! Sabina Lynch!”
and what else I could not guess.</p>

<p>“Next day,” said Eva, “a large number of the
Geraldines left Askeaton, and Fitzgerald, being won
over entirely to me, told me he would endeavour
that night, there being but few men in the castle,
to effect your escape and mine also. In the evening
the gallowglasses drank deep&mdash;deeper even than
they knew, for their wine and aqua vitæ had been
drugged&mdash;and then, when all was still, he came
to me who was ready, waiting. I asked him
where you were, and he replied that he wished
me to go with him to you, as you would trust
me, and not, perhaps, him.”</p>

<p>“I see it all,” said I.</p>

<p>“Going up to the room where you lay,” continued
Eva, “we heard a noise; that made us pause,
then we went on again&mdash;and you know the rest.
The noise we had heard had so far alarmed us
that we thought it best to tell you what we did.
Fitzgerald had seen to everything&mdash;said I not
rightly that he was my friend?”</p>

<p>And now Burke cried again, as Eva stopped
speaking, “What is to be done? What is to be
done?” For myself, while I echoed his question,
I was in so great a coil that I was as one dumb.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>“ONLY A WOMAN.”</small></h2>


<p>“What is to be done?” asked Richard Burke.</p>

<p>“We must find out, first of all, where Grace
O’Malley is.” It was Eva who spoke, and what she
said was true. Our mistress must now be our chief&mdash;nay,
our whole concern.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried I, roused to action, and looking
with admiration at this weak little woman, who had
shown herself so strong.</p>

<p>“Let us call in the woman you spoke of,” said
Burke. “She may remember something which will
put us on the scent.”</p>

<p>“I fear she has told me all that she knows,” said
Eva; “but summon her here.”</p>

<p>While we waited for her I was going over what
Eva had told us, and trying also to recall exactly
what had been the words used&mdash;even more than the
words, the manner of Fitzmaurice&mdash;when I had
parted from him at Tralee. And as I considered
the matter the conviction was borne in upon me
that he had had some information as to what had
happened in regard to Desmond and my mistress,
but that he had purposely said nothing of it to me.</p>

<p>For one thing, he had evidently intended to keep
me with him, and so to prevent me from returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to Askeaton; and, for another, he had spoken of
Grace O’Malley in a way which was little short of
an insult, and which I was quick to resent. Then
de Vilela had intervened between us, Fitzmaurice
had made an apology, and I had left Tralee without
opposition or further words.</p>

<p>What had de Vilela said when I had declared
that my place was with my mistress? That I had
spoken a true word, and I remembered that when
he uttered this it was with little of his customary
serenity of demeanour.</p>

<p>I concluded, as I reflected on what had passed,
that both Fitzmaurice and de Vilela must have
been aware&mdash;at least, to some extent, of Desmond’s
base conduct with respect to her.</p>

<p>Nor was the cause of this silence far to seek.
But imperfectly informed, most probably, of the
whole circumstances, and what they had heard
having reached them from some source favourable
to Desmond, they were, perhaps, inclined to lay the
blame upon my mistress.</p>

<p>Then, the Earl’s adhesion to the cause was so
essential for its success that whoever jeopardised it
would be looked upon with hatred, and thus they
would be the more prejudiced against her.</p>

<p>Yet Fitzmaurice had himself told me in effect
that he was not sure of Desmond, and this before
he knew anything of Grace O’Malley. Perchance,
however, he had persuaded himself that he believed
what he wished to believe.</p>

<p>And de Vilela? He had sprung to the defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
of my mistress, but if he knew what had occurred,
why had he not spoken out? No doubt, I told
myself, it was because, while he was ready to uphold
her honour, he deemed that his duty towards his
master, the King of Spain, was paramount, and he
had therefore submitted to Fitzmaurice, who was
his leader, and who had enjoined silence upon him.
This, I surmised, was the explanation.</p>

<p>How much did they know?</p>

<p>Could they say, I wondered, where Desmond had
put my mistress?</p>

<p>Where was she at this moment?</p>

<p>The tire-woman had now entered the tent, but,
although she was most willing to tell us all she knew,
she had no knowledge, it appeared, of the place to
which Grace O’Malley had been taken.</p>

<p>“A castle a few miles from Limerick,” and no
more could we get from her. And Desmond, or the
chiefs who regarded him as their prince, had more
than one castle answering this description.</p>

<p>The important matter was that Desmond had not
at once delivered her over to the President of Munster.</p>

<p>First, he was trying to convince her that his
was no empty threat; and, second, to bend or break
her spirit. But I knew that, while he might succeed
in the one, he never would in the other. And he
would see this so soon that I had no doubt whatever
that at most not more than two or three days would
elapse before she had been lodged in the prison of
Limerick, for I was now certain of the complete
perfidy of Desmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who could betray his guest was not
likely to be true to any cause. That he had sent
Fitzmaurice’s letter to the President was, I considered,
a thing not only possible, but in the highest
degree probable. Thus the prospect on all sides of
us was dark indeed.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, then, Grace O’Malley would be
in the power of the English, at the mercy of the
President of Munster, a helpless captive in Limerick
gaol! She might be there already, for aught we
knew, and therefore it behoved us at once to endeavour
to discover if she were shut up in Limerick.</p>

<p>And, if haply this were the case, what could we
do? What could my mistress look for at the hands
of the English? How could we assist her? It
might even now be too late, and my flesh crept
upon my bones at the thought.</p>

<p>“I will go to Limerick,” said I, as the result of
my reflections; but when we had discussed the
matter it appeared to be better that someone else
should be sent.</p>

<p>“I am too marked a man.” said Burke; and one
of his gallowglasses would do as well, for, if Grace
O’Malley were in Limerick gaol, there was not a soul
in that city who would not know of it, and thus
anyone on the spot could easily obtain the knowledge
we sought.</p>

<p>I was not persuaded to this course without much
difficulty, and Burke himself was most determined at
first to go; but there was the same objection in his
case that there was in mine. Neither of us could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
been long in the streets of Limerick without being
recognised. At length, a messenger was despatched,
Burke going out from the tent to tell him what he
was to do.</p>

<p>No sooner had Burke left Eva and myself alone
together, than my dear fell a-weeping, as if her heart
would break, all her wonderful fortitude utterly gone.
I took her into my arms&mdash;these great, strong arms
of mine, now weak and trembling like those of a little
child&mdash;and tried to soothe her grief. Perhaps my
love and our common sorrow taught us what to say,
yet I spoke not of love at all. But what I said and
what she said about ourselves I cannot put into
writing&mdash;and I would not, if I could, for there are
words and there are times which are sacred beyond
expression; and such were those words, and such this
time.</p>

<p>She was my love and I was hers; and though we
spoke not of it, we both knew, and the knowledge of
it folded us about like a garment.</p>

<p>Much, too, had we to say to each other about
de Vilela and about Fitzgerald, and how strangely
they had passed in and out, out and in, of the woof
of our lives. She evidently had a kind of affection
for them both, and when I was inclined to question
her about this she said that they had both been
wounded and helpless, and that she had nursed and
tended them, and so had come by this feeling. But
ever as our talk came back to Grace O’Malley our
hearts were heavy.</p>

<p>The messenger whom the MacWilliam had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to Limerick returned in the evening. He had seen
and had spoken to many of the inhabitants of that
city, and he could hear of nothing which indicated
that Grace O’Malley was there. We took courage
from this report, hoping that the worst had not
come upon her. But the man had something more
to tell us.</p>

<p>As he was on his way back from Limerick he
had fallen in with a great gathering of armed men,
moving on eastward, some three or four miles to the
south of the city. These were Spaniards, he declared,
and other foreigners, as well as a large number of the
Irish. And there were priests with them, and in the
midst of them a banner, all blue and gold, with the
figure of the Lord upon it.</p>

<p>This could be nothing other than the army of
Fitzmaurice, accompanied by Sanders and the
standard blessed by the Pope.</p>

<p>I questioned the man narrowly as to the place
where he had seen them, and if he had heard where
they were going. He replied that one had told him
that they were to camp that night on the banks of
the river Mulkern, not far from the Slieve Phelim
Mountains, and that when he met them they could
not have been above two leagues’ distance from the
ground which had been chosen. Feeling fairly
certain that Fitzmaurice would be with them, and,
perhaps, de Vilela also, I resolved to set out at once
for their camp.</p>

<p>If I saw Fitzmaurice, I would try to find out from
him where Grace O’Malley was, and, further, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
determined to appeal to him to endeavour to prevent
Desmond from carrying out his plans. As my
mistress had not been taken into Limerick, the
probability was that the Earl had not finally broken
with Fitzmaurice, and that negotiations were still
going on between them. There was, therefore, a
chance that Fitzmaurice might prevail upon him to
set her at liberty.</p>

<p>“Tell Fitzmaurice,” said Richard Burke, when I
had informed him of what I proposed, “that unless
Grace O’Malley is released immediately, the Burkes
of Mayo will take neither part nor lot with the
Geraldines in this affair.”</p>

<p>This suggested to me a possibility I had not yet
contemplated, but I thrust it away from me, telling
myself that Burke was too much distraught to know
what he was saying. But it kept coming back to
my mind, as I rode that night along with a guard
of the Burkes towards the Mulkern.</p>

<p>When we were within a few paces of the camp,
which we found without any difficulty, we were
challenged by a Spanish sentinel. I could not give
him password or countersign, and he had raised his
piece to his shoulder to fire, when he suddenly
dropped it again, saying he remembered my face,
having seen me at Limerick and also at Tralee.
Having asked him if Sir James Fitzmaurice was
here, he replied that he was, as were also the other
leaders. When I told him that I had business with
Sir James, and when he saw how small was the guard
with me, he said he would take it upon himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
allow me to pass within the lines, although it was
contrary to his orders. He therefore directed me,
pointing through the camp fires, to the spot where
Fitzmaurice’s tent had been pitched.</p>

<p>And now I must put on record, as carefully as
I can, what passed between Fitzmaurice and myself,
so that all men can judge whether Richard Burke,
Grace O’Malley’s lover, and I, Ruari Macdonald, her
servant, were justified in what we afterwards did,
or not.</p>

<p>When Fitzmaurice saw me he was unmistakably
surprised, for he started violently as I entered his
tent. Perhaps he had thought I was still immured
at Askeaton, and so out of the way; but that I know
not. Besides, when we had last parted it had been
in no very friendly fashion. Whatever his feelings
now were, he put on a garb of welcome as soon as his
first surprise was past.</p>

<p>“Greeting&mdash;a thousand greetings!” said he. “You
have come to join us? How many men have you
brought with you?”</p>

<p>“Greeting!” said I, then I fixed my gaze sternly
on him, for if I was right in the opinions I held
all words of welcome were out of place between us;
and continued, “Sir James, I have not come to join
you&mdash;not at present, at any rate. That is not the
business which brings me here. I have come to
ask you if you know where my mistress, Grace
O’Malley, is?”</p>

<p>I was in no humour to pick and choose what forms
of speech I should use, and I spoke out sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, frowning, all his cordiality disappearing
instantly, “what should I know of your
mistress, Grace O’Malley?” And there was a trace
of mockery in the way he uttered the last four words.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Sir James,” said I again. “Nay,
you need not, for I can see that you do know.”</p>

<p>“I have heard something,” said he, at length.</p>

<p>“Do you know how the matter stands between
her and Desmond?” asked I. “Do you know that
she was his guest&mdash;invited by him to Askeaton?
Do you know that she has tried to bind him to the
cause? Do you know that he has told her that he
has a passion for her, that he holds her as a prisoner
in one of his castles because she will not submit to
him, and that he has threatened to give her up to
the English, and to make common cause with them
against you, if she will not yield herself to him?”</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice said nothing, but sat scowling at me,
and biting his lip.</p>

<p>“Have you no answer?” asked I. “You say you
have heard something; perhaps you knew all this
before I left you at Tralee.”</p>

<p>Then changing my tone to one almost of entreaty,
I said, “Sir James, bethink yourself before it is too
late. Nothing but evil can come from these acts
of Desmond,” and I gave him the message with
which Richard Burke had charged me. “Grace
O’Malley,” I concluded, “must be set free, and that
at once. Do you know where she is?”</p>

<p>“Ruari Macdonald!” thundered he with curses,
“you always had a proud stomach! Who are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to speak to me in this fashion? What have I to
do with your mistress? What if I do know where
she is? What affair of mine is it? Go and seek
Desmond.”</p>

<p>But he had said enough.</p>

<p>“You know where she is,” cried I, wildly. “Tell
me, and I will go and find Desmond.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and ruin all,” said he half to himself. “No,
I will not tell you; that would be but to add to
the mischief. No! Grace O’Malley must yield to
Desmond, and then all will be well.”</p>

<p>“Yield to Desmond!” exclaimed I. “She will
never do that.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but she will be forced to do so,” said he,
with a horrible smile.</p>

<p>“Never!” said I. “I know her better than you
do; she will die rather than submit.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, fiercely, “let her die!”</p>

<p>“Is that your last word?” asked I, furiously.</p>

<p>He rose up at me like an angry beast, and,
shaking his outstretched hand at me, shouted,
“Curses on you both! Who is your mistress, as
you call her, and what is she to stand in the way
of a Desmond? Who is she to come between us
and the deliverance of Ireland? Shall a woman
block up the path&mdash;only a woman!” And on he
went in his wrath, saying many injurious things of
Grace O’Malley, until at last he applied to her the
vilest of names.</p>

<p>As his rage swelled, and his language became
more and more insulting, I grew calmer, until I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
possessed by a very devil of deadly coldness. But
when he used the expression I have hinted at, I
could keep my peace no longer.</p>

<p>“You lie!” said I, and out came my sword. Nor
was he less ready; and there we stood for a second
facing each other, with the candles flickering this
way and that between us. Then he thrust his sword
back into its sheath, and saying, “What need of this
fool’s blood!” shouted loudly to someone outside the
tent. There was the quick tramp of men, and in
came some Spaniards, with de Vilela at their head.</p>

<p>“You here!” cried de Vilela, when he saw me.</p>

<p>“Secure him, bind him,” said Fitzmaurice,
pointing at me.</p>

<p>De Vilela looked from one to the other of us,
his face very grave, but did not stir.</p>

<p>“Bind him! I command you,” said Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>De Vilela stood still.</p>

<p>“What!” shouted Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>De Vilela said slowly, “May I ask, señor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may ask nothing,” yelled Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>De Vilela went white to the lips; but he spoke
with that habitual courtesy of his, as, pulling out his
sword and offering it to Fitzmaurice by the handle,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I cannot do this thing, for this man is as my
brother! I am your prisoner also, señor. Do with
me as you will!” Then this loyal gentleman added,
turning to the Spanish soldiers, “Long live the
King!” and they, too, said, “Long live the
King!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take mine!” cried I, holding out my sword
to him&mdash;so moved out of myself was I.</p>

<p>“Nay; that I cannot do either,” said he.</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” asked Fitzmaurice of de Vilela.
“You must be mad. Has that woman bewitched
you too?” And he wrung his hands.</p>

<p>“Señor,” said I to de Vilela, “words have passed
between Sir James Fitzmaurice and myself about my
mistress that can only be wiped out in one way,” and
I glanced at my sword.</p>

<p>De Vilela sighed.</p>

<p>“Señor Fitzmaurice will, I am sure, not refuse?”
asked the Spaniard, courteous as ever.</p>

<p>“No, I will not refuse,” said Fitzmaurice. “All
men know me; but it cannot be now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said de Vilela&mdash;Fitzmaurice had not taken
the proffered sword&mdash;”no one will impugn your
courage. But if you do not refuse, you will not seek
to detain this man?” And he looked searchingly at
Fitzmaurice, who did not answer, but curtly nodded
assent.</p>

<p>“Go, Señor Ruari!” said de Vilela; but I stood
firm.</p>

<p>“Go,” said Fitzmaurice. “Do not fear, we shall
meet again!”</p>

<p>“To meet again, then,” I said, and went out from
the tent.</p>

<p>Summoning my men, I returned, darkly brooding
over these strange happenings, to the camp of the
Burkes. I had failed entirely to compass the object
for which I had set out, for I was no nearer knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
where Desmond had taken my mistress. But Fitzmaurice
knew, and when I recalled what he had said
my heart overflowed with bitterness.</p>

<p>I would be just to this man, if I could. I can
see now, looking across the grave of the years, that
he viewed my mistress solely in the light of an
obstacle in his path, and so he cared not what her
fate was, so long as she was out of the way.</p>

<p>“Only a woman!” he had said of her, and that
she was only a woman doubtless increased his sense
of injury. But he forgot that it was for “only a
woman” that men have ever fought and died.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the camp, Richard Burke was
waiting for me. When he had heard me to the end,
he said, “You should have killed him!” I had had
the same thought myself, but de Vilela and the
Spanish soldiers had come too quickly upon the
scene for that. Besides, we should meet again, and
thus I comforted my soul.</p>

<p>“Let us to sleep,” said I.</p>

<p>“I cannot sleep,” said he, and I heard him pacing
up and down through the rest of what remained of
the night, for though I shut my eyes, no sleep came
to me either.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE PARTING OF THE WAYS.</small></h2>


<p>I have seen a great swell of the sea, a mountain of a
wave&mdash;caused by some violent storm which has spent
its worst fury many leagues away&mdash;roll in from the
ocean, lift a ship from her moorings, and dash her to
pieces on the rocks.</p>

<p>As I rose in the morning and stepped out of the
tent into the dewy freshness of the day, I thought we
were not unlike that ship. For I could not disguise
from myself that our affairs had suffered shipwreck.</p>

<p>Grace O’Malley was a prisoner, and I was unable
to deliver her. I, her servant, was bound before anything
else to try to free her from her captivity, and I
did not even know where she was; and when I had
sought to find it out, it had been with the result that
a furious quarrel had sprung up between Fitzmaurice,
the leader of the Irish, and myself.</p>

<p>He had not only refused to help me to obtain her
liberty, but he had slandered and contemned her to
my face. Not under such a man could I or the
O’Malleys fight. Nay, there now could be nothing
between us but the deadliest feud.</p>

<p>And yet we had all come to Kerry to stand by the
side of this man and his Spaniards in the rising against
the Queen! That, at least, was now impossible. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
could we support one who had spoken of our mistress
and chief as he had done? And the Burkes were in
the same position as we ourselves.</p>

<p>As I paced along the ground, Richard Burke,
gaunt and hollow-eyed, joined me. Burning with
resentment and indignation, he was eager for instant
action, and made the wild proposal that I should
immediately bring all the men from the galleys, and,
having made a junction with him and his forces,
march against Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>At the first blush of the thing I had almost said
yes; but a little cool reflection showed me that not
only were the odds against us overwhelming, but
that, even if we were successful, I should be no nearer
my main object, which was the release of Grace
O’Malley. So far as I was concerned, all the considerations
had to bow to that.</p>

<p>Nor could I readily bring myself in a moment, as
it were, into an attitude of hostility to Fitzmaurice,
for he represented our cause against the English, and
to fight him was, in effect, to help the enemy.</p>

<p>Having told the MacWilliam all that was in my
mind, and having won him over to my way of thinking,
we considered how we should now proceed. It
appeared to me to be best that we should all return
to the ships, for the camp of the Burkes, being in the
heart of Desmond’s country, was very open to attack
from the Geraldines, who could no longer be regarded
as friends, and so might easily be surprised and taken.</p>

<p>There was also the strong argument that, if any
disaster overtook the galleys in our absence, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
should be completely cut off from any way of getting
back to Connaught, and our situation would become
desperate and well nigh hopeless.</p>

<p>Another reason was that we could, with even
greater advantage than from the place where the
Burkes were camped, send out from the galleys
scouts and spies, with a view to ascertaining where
Desmond was.</p>

<p>To that I now bent my whole energy, for I felt
sure that so long as Grace O’Malley was not in the
gaol of Limerick&mdash;if she were, then would she be
harder to come at than ever&mdash;she would be confined
in some castle which the Earl occupied with his
forces, and where he would remain until he was
convinced that he could neither bend nor break her
will. For that, I knew, would be the end.</p>

<p>Having struck our camp, we marched to the westward,
so as to avoid Askeaton; then, going to the
north, were safely on board the galleys by the
evening, having only encountered on our journey
several small bands of the Irish on their way to
Fitzmaurice, whom we suffered to pass on, having
first asked them if they had any information as to
where Desmond was. They had been told, it appeared,
that the Earl had raised the standard of
revolt, and was in camp with Fitzmaurice on the
Mulkern. Nor did we undeceive them.</p>

<p>For a week I kept the galleys sailing up and down
the Shannon, stopping every mile or two and sending
men ashore&mdash;sometimes going myself&mdash;to speak with
the inhabitants; but never a word could we hear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Desmond, though occasionally we heard of Fitzmaurice,
who had not moved from the position he
had taken up.</p>

<p>Each evening of that terrible week found me less
hopeful and more despondent; in truth, I would have
despaired had it not been for the constant solace
of Eva, who seemed to have changed herself into
another person, so brave and steadfast was she.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had kept well away from Limerick, but
now I resolved to bring the galleys as close up to the
walls of the city as I dared. Limerick was a great
and strongly fortified place, and, therefore, to be
avoided by us; but it was the centre of all that part
of Ireland, and there might be opportunities in its
neighbourhood of hearing more fully what was going
forward. I was encouraged to do this, also, by the
fact that there were singularly few ships in the river&mdash;no
doubt owing to the presence of the Spaniards in
the country.</p>

<p>When we were yet perhaps a league from the
walls we saw a small boat with a sail coming towards
us. I looked keenly at her, and even as I looked at
her she was suddenly put about, and was headed
back for the city, for they evidently did not like our
appearance.</p>

<p>Two of the men in her seemed to be soldiers, and
I signalled Tibbot, whose galley was leading, to
capture her&mdash;which he did after a short chase, the
occupants of the boat surrendering without any
resistance.</p>

<p>I had the two soldiers, as they proved to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
brought on board of <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and having
assured them that I intended them no harm, asked
how matters stood in the city. The first words they
uttered were enough to stun me.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley,” said one of them, “was brought
into Limerick yesterday, and delivered up to Sir
Nicholas Malby.”</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley in Limerick,” I cried, “and Sir
Nicholas Malby there also!”</p>

<p>The fatality of the thing completely broke down
my control, and I could not speak for some minutes.
I had somehow felt all along that my mistress would
be given up to the English by Desmond, but to be
told that this had actually come to pass was none the
less a crushing blow. And to Sir Nicholas Malby,
the Colonel of Connaught, our implacable foe!</p>

<p>The two men gazed at me curiously, seeing how
overcome I was.</p>

<p>“How comes Sir Nicholas Malby to be in
Limerick?” I asked, pulling myself together. “Connaught
is his government, not Munster; how does he
happen to be here?”</p>

<p>“You surely must know,” said the man who had
spoken before, “that Sir James Fitzmaurice, one of
the Desmonds, has arrived in the country at the head
of a large army from Spain, and that the Irish people
are flocking in to him from all quarters?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, shortly, “I know all that.”</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas Malby was summoned by the President
of Munster,” said the soldier, “in hot haste to
the defence of Limerick. We were in garrison at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
time at Athlone, several hundred of us, and Sir
Nicholas, having marshalled us in our companies,
immediately set off in response down the Shannon,
and two days ago we arrived here. The President
is terror-stricken, and the whole city trembles with
fear.”</p>

<p>“How came you to be without the walls?” I
asked. “And at such a time?”</p>

<p>“We were trying to escape,” said the man, “for
we heard that the city would soon be taken by the
Spaniards, of whom there are thousands, and that
everyone of us would be tortured and slain by them.”</p>

<p>“Is the Earl of Desmond in Limerick?” I next
inquired&mdash;noting, however, how the number of Fitzmaurice’s
men had been exaggerated.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man. “He sent Grace O’Malley
bound in chains into the city to Sir Nicholas Malby,
but he came not himself. ’Tis said that he will
neither join the Spaniards, nor yet assist us, but holds
himself aloof from both until he sees on whose side
fortune will declare itself.”</p>

<p>And this reed of rottenness, this catspaw of the
wind, was the man whom my mistress, led on by the
memories of the past greatness of the house of
Desmond, and by the hope that under him the Irish
might unite, had called our natural leader!</p>

<p>It had been the noble dream of a noble soul, that
vision of hers; but, like many another noble dream, it
was woven around a man incapable of filling the part
he was called upon to play, and so was nothing but a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>The folly and wickedness of Desmond seemed to
me to be almost inconceivable. Baulked by the firmness
of my mistress, he had wreaked his wrath upon
her by handing her over to the one man in all Ireland
who might be supposed to regard her capture with the
utmost joy, and who would take a fiendish delight in
torturing her.</p>

<p>Having gratified his hatred of her&mdash;for such his
love no doubt had become&mdash;the Earl sought to
stand in with both sides in the approaching struggle
by coming out openly on behalf of neither. It
needed not that one should be a prophet to forecast
that Desmond would fall and be crushed between
the two.</p>

<p>While such thoughts passed rapidly through my
mind, the chief thing which I had just been told&mdash;that
Grace O’Malley was immured in the gaol of Limerick&mdash;threw
everything else into the shade. In the
hope that the men might have heard what had
occurred to her after her arrival in Limerick, I asked
them:</p>

<p>“Do you know, or did you hear, what Sir
Nicholas Malby did in respect of Grace O’Malley,
after she had been delivered up to him?”</p>

<p>“I was one of his guard,” said the man who
acted as spokesman for the twain, “when she was
brought before him. Sir Nicholas eyed her with
great sternness; albeit it was easy to see that he
was well-pleased to have her in his power, for she
had wrought the English terrible injuries in Galway,
and had set him at defiance. However, she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
quail nor humble herself, but bore herself like a
princess, as, they say, she is.”</p>

<p>“What said Sir Nicholas?” asked I.</p>

<p>“He demanded of her many things,” replied
the man, “but she would answer him not at all.
Whereupon he was enraged against her, and gave
orders that the city gallows should be got ready
forthwith, and that she should be hanged immediately.”</p>

<p>“Did she not speak even then?”</p>

<p>“No. She looked at him very calmly and tranquilly,
like one, indeed, who had already tasted of
the bitterness of death and had no fear of it. A
strange woman, and a brave! But ’tis said she is
a witch.”</p>

<p>“What happened after that?”</p>

<p>“We were leading her away to the square in
which the gibbet stands, when Sir Nicholas called
to us to come back, for he had changed his mind,
as it now appeared. Said he to her, ’You will not
dance in the air to-day, mistress, but I shall take
good care that you dance not out of Limerick as
you did out of Galway!’ But to what he alluded
when he said that I know not. Thereafter she was
cast into one of the dungeons of the place.”</p>

<p>“One of the dungeons?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;there are several deep, dark dungeons
below the gaol of Limerick, and she was thrust into
one of these.”</p>

<p>I had heard enough, and having sent the two
soldiers away in charge of some of my men, I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and told Richard Burke the evil tidings. Up to
this moment he must have cherished the hope that
Grace O’Malley would in some way or other escape,
for he was utterly unmanned on hearing where and
in whose hands she was, and abandoned himself to
the wildest grief. The very colour of his face
showed that he already regarded her as one dead.
As for myself, there had grown upon me a kind of
coldness, and an icy numbness, as it were, which
seemed to have killed all feeling within me for the time.</p>

<p>And perhaps it was well that this was the case,
else I should never have been able to carry the
news to Eva. Yet she must be told, and tell her
I did.</p>

<p>“So long as she is alive,” exclaimed Eva, when
I had come to the end of my tale, “there is hope.
I will not believe that it is her destiny to perish in
this manner!”</p>

<p>What had become of the timid, shrinking girl?
For my dear was transformed altogether, being now
full of courage, and of purpose and determination.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said she, “what Sir Nicholas is;
how greedy of money he is, how avaricious! Think
you he would not sell Grace O’Malley for gold?
Only offer him enough, and he will set her free.”</p>

<p>I thought of the immense treasure which lay in
the Caves of Silence under the Hill of Sorrow, and
for a minute I considered that Eva’s suggestion
might avail us. But the caves were far away
from Limerick, and to go thither was out of the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, the English rule was too seriously threatened
to permit Sir Nicholas to be moved at this
time by bribes, however rich they were. If he
opened his hands, liberating Grace O’Malley with
his right, and taking her gold with his left, it would
not be now: the situation of the English was far
too perilous for that.</p>

<p>All this I saw with perfect clearness, and when
I spoke to Eva of it, she was at first inclined to fly
out at me, and to reproach me for my apathy.
Yet, God wot, it was not apathy; I simply could
not see any way out for us, or, rather, for our
mistress, no matter in what direction I looked. All
that I could think of was that I should get into
Limerick under some disguise, and then endeavour
to find the means of effecting her escape.</p>

<p>When I mentioned this to Eva, she replied that
to carry out such a plan would, or might, involve
too long a delay, for our mistress, being already condemned,
might be executed at any moment. This
was true; but, as I could not conceive of any other
scheme, I resolved to set about undertaking it, and
that no later than next day.</p>

<p>That night my sleep was troubled and uneasy,
and I tossed restlessly about, so that when the first
light of day was seen I sprang from my couch. As
I did so I heard Calvagh O’Halloran call my name
loudly, and at the same instant there was the sound
of oars; then Calvagh, as I stepped on deck, came
running towards me, crying something I could not
quite distinguish, and pointing to <i>The Grey Wolf</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
which had slipped her anchor, and was now being
rowed away from us in the direction of Limerick.</p>

<p>All this came upon me so suddenly that I could
scarcely grasp the meaning of it, until I noticed
Eva O’Malley standing on the poop of <i>The Grey
Wolf</i>, and waving her hand to me in farewell.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” I cried; but on went the galley
at racing speed. “Stop! stop!” I cried again; but
received no other response than that given by those
waving hands. I was on the point of ordering
Calvagh to get <i>The Cross of Blood</i> under weigh,
when I observed that Eva had sent Art O’Malley by
one of the small boats of <i>The Grey Wolf</i> to my
galley with a message for me.</p>

<p>“What is this? What is this?” I asked of
him.</p>

<p>“Eva O’Malley bids me tell you,” replied he,
“that she is going in to Limerick to see Sir
Nicholas Malby.”</p>

<p>“What?” I cried. “Has she gone crazed! To
see Nicholas Malby! What frenzy is this?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no frenzy, Ruari Macdonald,” said Art
O’Malley, “but her settled will. And she bade me
say that you must wait here, and she will return
to-night, or else, if she come not, that we must all
go to Limerick to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What is her intention?”</p>

<p>“That I know not. It was not till I was in the
boat that she gave me these words for you, and
none of us imagined, when the galley set out, that
you were not aware of what she was about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at the man in wonder.</p>

<p>“Have you no suspicion at all of what she would
be at?”</p>

<p>“To see Sir Nicholas Malby&mdash;as she said; I know
no more.”</p>

<p>In the circumstances there was nothing left me
to do but to wait and wonder, to wonder and to
wait.</p>

<p>What interpretation was I to put on this extraordinary,
this rash act of Eva’s? Did she think
she would be able to bribe Sir Nicholas? Was
that her idea? Or did she have some other plan?</p>

<p>But all these surmises were powerless to console
me; and it was with a gladness of heart to which
I had long been a stranger that I saw <i>The Grey
Wolf</i> come up alongside of us in the afternoon.</p>

<p>And who was that who stood by the side of my
dear on the poop-deck? Richard Burke was with
me, and I cried to him to look.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked I, astounded, doubting if
my eyes did not juggle with me.</p>

<p>“You may well ask,” said he. “Some miracle
must have come to pass!”</p>

<p>“Then ’tis he!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas Malby himself,” said Burke, and
his face was instantly lighted up with a new hope
rising in his breast.</p>

<p>“Ay, ’tis Sir Nicholas!” cried I. “By God’s
wounds, this is a strange thing!”</p>

<p>There they stood together&mdash;the Colonel of Connaught
and Eva O’Malley. Like Burke, my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
grew light, as if a great weight had been taken
from me, for I knew that Malby must have some
proposal to make us which must be to our advantage,
otherwise he would never thus have ventured
to come.</p>

<p>If he was not exactly alone, he had apparently
but few of his soldiers with him; and evidently,
therefore, he was determined to show us that whatever
it was he was to offer us was offered to men
in whom he had implicit faith.</p>

<p>And what had Eva said, what promised, what
undertaken for us? How had she managed to bring
him? What had this little weak woman, who could
yet be so great and strong, done?</p>

<p>And I still glow with a pride in her that is too
deep and too high for words when I think of it all.
Surely, it was nothing but a miracle, as Burke had
said. One thing, at least, was now certain, and that
was that Grace O’Malley was alive, or Malby would
not have come to us.</p>

<p><i>The Grey Wolf</i> having dropped her anchor, Eva
and Sir Nicholas immediately made signs to Richard
Burke and me to go over to them, and we hastened
to comply with their wish. As we approached, Sir
Nicholas saluted us both very courteously, and we
bowed low in return. Eva was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“I went this morning to Sir Nicholas,” said
Eva; “I was detained at the water gate, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are a brave as well as a beautiful woman,”
said he, interrupting her, “and I regret that there
was any delay at the gate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would have been singular,” replied she,
smiling, “if there had not been some opposition.
However, having stated who I was, I prevailed after
some time upon the captain of the watch to send
me to Sir Nicholas. I wished to see if Sir
Nicholas utterly refused to accept a ransom for
our mistress.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, eagerly. “We will pay it gladly.”</p>

<p>“He refused to receive a ransom, however,” said
Eva.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;&mdash;” asked I.</p>

<p>“He had better tell you himself what he proposes,”
said she. “He asked me if I thought you
would agree, and knowing how you and the MacWilliam
now feel with respect to Sir James
Fitzmaurice, I answered that I deemed it probable
enough. He next wished to know how he was to
convince you of his sincerity, and I suggested his
coming with me as a proof it. But that I have
passed my word to him, pledging you and Richard
Burke also to his safety, he is in our hands.”</p>

<p>“I will be frank with you,” said Sir Nicholas,
bluntly, “and not waste words. You wish to free
your mistress, and you have a quarrel with Sir James
Fitzmaurice so that you no longer can fight by his
side against us. If you and the MacWilliam will join
your men to mine, I will not only set Grace O’Malley
at liberty, but will confirm her in possession of her
estates in the Queen’s name, and also grant what
I know she desires in respect of her ships.” Sir
Nicholas paused, eyeing us narrowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>“The MacWilliam and I are proclaimed rebels,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Come to the aid of her Highness,” said he, “and
you will be rebels no longer.” Then, as he saw that
we both were silent, he said&mdash;and here he touched us
to the quick&mdash;”Have you no desire to be avenged on
Fitzmaurice and the Desmonds?”</p>

<p>“Ay, by the Mass, yes,” cried Burke.</p>

<p>“What say you, Ruari Macdonald?” asked Sir
Nicholas.</p>

<p>“Tell me first,” said I, “how stands Desmond in
this matter?”</p>

<p>“He has gone to Askeaton again,” said he, “and
as he will not declare himself for the Queen, he must
be judged to be against her.”</p>

<p>“Did you say anything to Grace O’Malley of this
errand of yours to us? Does she know of it?”
asked I.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he.</p>

<p>“And what is her word to us?”</p>

<p>“’Bid these men of mine avenge me, and that
right speedily.’ That was what she said.”</p>

<p>“Well spoken!” cried Richard Burke.</p>

<p>“I have never disobeyed her yet,” said I, “and I
shall not do so now.”</p>

<small>BARRINGTON BRIDGE.</small></h2>


<p>As we four stood facing each other on the poop of
<i>The Grey Wolf</i>, there was the sound of a door opened
and closed, and then the pit-pat of steps on the deck,
and well did I know who it was.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley!” cried I joyously, turning
towards her.</p>

<p>“Grace O’Malley!” said Richard Burke, and
could not say more for very gladness.</p>

<p>My mistress smiled upon us, as she gave one hand
to the MacWilliam and the other to me; but as I
gazed upon her I saw that those great eyes of hers
were deep-shadowed with sadness. And well could I
understand how the failure and defeat of her most
cherished hopes, brought about by the perfidy of
Desmond, and acquiesced in by Fitzmaurice, preyed
upon her mind and filled her with gloom. What she
now said to me showed how her thoughts ran.</p>

<p>“So you are become a Queen’s man, Ruari!”</p>

<p>“I am your servant, Grace O’Malley,” said I.
“What care I whose man I am, so long as I am
yours! If you say be a Queen’s man, then Queen’s
man am I.”</p>

<p>“And you, Richard Burke?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You well know what I would say!” answered he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is well,” said she; but if she had said, “It is
ill,” her accents could hardly have been more sober
or less exultant. And for myself, when I recalled the
image of de Vilela, who must henceforth be our foe,
and all that I owed him, I could not but share in and
sympathise with her feelings.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas Malby, perhaps guessing something
of what we were thinking, and anxious to reap the
fullest benefit as soon as possible from our alliance
with him, brought the conversation sharply round to
Fitzmaurice and the Geraldines.</p>

<p>He was enough of a tactician to say very little of the
past or of the Spaniards; only he harped incessantly
on the baseness with which our mistress had been
treated by her own countrymen, and so wrought upon
our desire for revenge.</p>

<p>“Here and now is your opportunity! There is no
time to be thrown away. Each day sees Fitzmaurice
in a stronger position, as men pour into his camp
from all directions. Desmond, meanwhile, like the
weakling he is, still hesitates. If we are to succeed,
the blow must be struck at once&mdash;should he join
Fitzmaurice, I may have to wait till soldiers come
from England; if we move at once, however, though
the enemy is more numerous than our combined
forces, we are, I believe, a match for them.”</p>

<p>“Tell us your plans,” said Richard Burke, and
thereupon Sir Nicholas began to discuss with us what
course was to be pursued.</p>

<p>He appeared to be well-informed of all that was
going on in the camp of Fitzmaurice, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
determined to offer him battle at once. With this
end in view, we agreed to move up the galleys that
very afternoon to Limerick, and anchor them in
the harbour within its walls.</p>

<p>It was not without misgivings that I consented to
this, for then we should be indeed at the mercy of Sir
Nicholas; but he was so fair and open with us, and
had so placed himself, without reserve, as it were, in
our hands, that I gave way; nor, as the event showed,
was our trust misplaced.</p>

<p>I returned to <i>The Cross of Blood</i>, and in a very
few minutes, the three galleys were on their way to
Limerick, where their appearance shortly afterwards
created no small stir among its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thinking that Grace O’Malley and Eva would
prefer being left together, I had taken Sir Nicholas on
board of my ship; and he and Burke and I considered
the situation of affairs, and resolved that next morning
we should all march out from Limerick and
engage Fitzmaurice. Sir Nicholas estimated our
whole force at a thousand men, most of whom were
hardened soldiers and veterans of war, nor did he
anticipate that we should meet with any strenuous
resistance, save from the Spanish troops, who would
be certain to fight desperately.</p>

<p>One favour I asked of Sir Nicholas, and only one.
I told him that there was amongst the Spaniards
a gentleman&mdash;a certain de Vilela&mdash;to whom I was
beholden by the greatest of obligations, and I begged
of him this boon&mdash;if it should be the fortune of war
that Don Francisco were taken alive, then that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
should be given up to me upon my paying such a
ransom as would satisfy the captors. And to this
Sir Nicholas very willingly consented.</p>

<p>After we had come into port, and the galleys were
made fast to the quay, Sir Nicholas went on into the
city to give orders with respect to his soldiers and to
prepare for the morrow. But, ere he left us, he said
he would either come himself to see me late that
night to give us his final commands, or would send
one of his chief captains in his place.</p>

<p>As I watched that sturdy figure of his, I recalled
that when I had last talked with him it was on the
night of the revel in Galway, and could not but
marvel at the strange dance both he and I had
been led by fate since that time.</p>

<p>Also I did not fail to reflect that, while Sir
Nicholas had spoken confidently of our ability to
cope with the enemy, he must have deemed his
position to be critical in the extreme, or he never
would have made terms with us. Nothing but the
stern compulsion of necessity could have forced him
to act as he had done&mdash;nothing else, indeed, could
have justified him.</p>

<p>I was sure, being acquainted with the nature of
the man, that it would have been more congenial to
him to have fought us, as well as Fitzmaurice. Being
placed, however, as he was, he had seen, with the
quickness and shrewdness of a man well versed in
affairs, how he could make use of the division
between us and Fitzmaurice, and turn it to his
profit and the service of the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>His need of us must have been very great for
him not only to have to relinquish the vengeance
he had vowed against my mistress and myself, but also
to ask for our aid. But would our assistance suffice?</p>

<p>My heart beat fast and quickly as I thought that
the morrow’s battle might have a very different result
from that which he expected. To say the least, our
victory was very uncertain, seeing that our combined
forces were probably far outnumbered by those of
Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>After I had spent an hour or two musing in this
fashion, I saw Eva appear on the deck of <i>The Grey
Wolf</i>. All my doubt of the issue of the morrow
vanished immediately, and a swelling tide of love
and tenderness swept over me as I beheld my dear.
In truth, I had loved her all my life; but there was
now mingled with my love a feeling that was close
akin to worship, for what had not she dared?</p>

<p>Thank God, I say again, for the great hearts of
women!</p>

<p>She did not at once perceive me, and I observed from
the pensive droop of her head and of her body that
she was weary. There was now nought between us&mdash;but
a few feet of water; and I quickly made my way
to her side. She greeted me with a radiant smile,
and love’s own light was shining in her soft eyes.</p>

<p>“Ruari!”</p>

<p>And love, too, was in her voice.</p>

<p>Long did we hold sweet converse together, saying
such fond things to each other as lovers say; but it is
not for me to set them forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>When I asked her what had put it into her mind
to go to Sir Nicholas Malby, she replied that after the
conversation we had had, in which she had suggested
offering a large sum to him as a ransom for Grace
O’Malley&mdash;a notion which I had scouted&mdash;she had pondered
the matter, and had resolved, without informing
me of her intention, to endeavour to gain admittance
to Sir Nicholas, and to tell him that he had only to
name what amount of treasure he required to purchase
our mistress’s liberty, and it would be given.</p>

<p>“I felt an irresistible impulse,” said Eva, “and it
was so strong upon me that I could get no rest until I
had seen Sir Nicholas.”</p>

<p>“Did Sir Nicholas receive you well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Eva. “He was disposed to
regard my appearance as most fortunate, for he had
already been casting about for some means of communicating
with you and the MacWilliam.”</p>

<p>And here our talk was interrupted by the sharp
ringing of the hoofs of horses upon the stones of the
quay, the clank of arms, and shouted words of command.</p>

<p>“Sir Nicholas again!” cried I, and we went forward
to meet him.</p>

<p>“All is well,” said he briefly, but briskly. “I wish
you to disembark your men&mdash;&mdash;” and here he stopped;
“but where is Richard Burke?”</p>

<p>“He is with Grace O’Malley,” said Eva.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas stood for an instant lost in thought.</p>

<p>“Rumours have reached us,” said he, at length,
“that the MacWilliam is greatly desirous of allying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
himself with Grace O’Malley more nearly than as
a mere comrade and friend in war.”</p>

<p>His words were a question, and I could almost
have sworn there was a twinkle in those fierce
eyes of his.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” I answered, seeing no need
for any equivocation or denial.</p>

<p>“It would be no bad thing,” said he, “for after
what has passed they will surely be loyal to her
Highness.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, somewhat drily, “but that will
also depend upon her Highness.”</p>

<p>“Her Highness,” cried he, “can mean nothing
but good to this her realm of Ireland. Peace
and quiet are essential to its prosperity, and these
she will have, and so, by God, shall I.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and see them,” said I; for what
he had said seemed to me very like halloaing before
we were out of the wood, as it were.</p>

<p>When we entered the cabin, I saw at once that
my mistress had recovered something of her usual
spirits, while Richard Burke’s honest face was
bright with happiness. It needed no voice to tell
me that he had again made suit to her, and that
she had not repulsed him.</p>

<p>And so best, thought I.</p>

<p>But there was a stern business before us, for we
must win our way to the hands of our brides across
a field of blood.</p>

<p>Sir Nicholas began at once to tell us what he had
arranged with respect to us and his English troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
At dawn we were all to cross the Shannon, and,
plunging into the forest, march upon the camp of
Fitzmaurice. He trusted that he might come upon
Sir James unawares, or, at any rate, before he had
had time to make the best disposition of his men.</p>

<p>When all these matters had been settled between
us, we bade Grace O’Malley and Eva farewell.</p>

<p>“Wear this,” said Grace O’Malley, on parting, to
Richard Burke, taking a ring from her finger and
putting it into his hand, “and wear it for my sake.”</p>

<p>As for myself, I had secretly possessed myself
of a silken riband of Eva’s, and twined it about the
guard of my sword. That was guerdon enough for
me until I should return to claim her.</p>

<p>“Victory!” cried my mistress to me.</p>

<p>“Amen and amen to that!” said Sir Nicholas and
we all, in a breath.</p>

<p>Then we went, each one to his place, and the
darkness covered us all till morning came.</p>

<p>In the twilight of the dawn we assembled to the
sound of trumpets, and then were rapidly carried
across the river to its south side, landing about two
miles east of Limerick.</p>

<p>The troops of Sir Nicholas were composed of
Englishmen and of Irishmen too, though these were
chiefly from the Pale; all men who had taken part in
many a fight, and gloried in nothing so much as in
the red riot of war. Two hundred of them were
mounted, and a hundred, or perhaps more, bore
arquebuses upon their shoulders. But the major
portion of them were armed with long pikes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
nearly all had swords or daggers. The Burkes and
the O’Malleys had the Irish sword and the stabbing
poniard and the still more terrible battle-axe.</p>

<p>The men on horseback went first; then the
MacWilliam and I with our men, followed by the
soldiers with arquebuses; last of all, Sir Nicholas
and his pike-men.</p>

<p>Such was the order of our march until we were
within half a mile of the outposts of Fitzmaurice’s
camp. But already his spies had warned him of our
approach, and we could hear, even at that distance,
the noise of the commotion among his forces as they
prepared to receive us.</p>

<p>We now advanced more slowly, throwing out
single soldiers here and there among the trees, while
the mounted men were halted.</p>

<p>The main body was massed together as closely as
the nature of the ground would permit, Sir Nicholas
himself directing all our movements with the utmost
coolness and unconcern.</p>

<p>As we pressed onward there was a sharp crack of
an arquebus, then another and another, until the air
was full of the sounds of firing; and then the men
who had been sent forward fell back, crying that the
Spaniards were drawn up in battle array, and were
waiting to fall upon us so soon as we came near.
Before we emerged from the forest into the open
Sir Nicholas brought up his arquebusiers, bidding
Burke and myself to support them. At the same
time he ordered his mounted men to the front.</p>

<p>When we burst out from among the trees we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
met by a hail of bullets from the pieces of the
Spaniards, and a cloud of whirring arrows seemed to
form and break over our heads. For a time we were
thrown back, but returning, like a wave flinging itself
upon the shore, rushed furiously on the enemy, the
arquebusiers of Sir Nicholas meanwhile pouring a
deadly fire in upon the ranks of Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p>There was the sudden hoarse blare of a trumpet,
the strident voice of Sir Nicholas crying on us to
charge, and our horsemen threw themselves madly
upon the foe, who sullenly gave way before them, but
only to form up quickly again. The men opposed to
them were neither cowards nor strangers to the art of
war; they were rallied speedily by their captains, and
soon presented a new front to our attack.</p>

<p>The air was so darkened by smoke, and there was
such a tumult from the shoutings of the soldiers and
the clang and clamour of their weapons and all the
wild work of war, that it was some time before I
could make out de Vilela among the Spaniards. But
there he was, his long sword gleaming in his hand,
his lips moving, and, though I could not hear what
he was saying, I could well imagine that he was
exhorting his men to remember Spain, and to acquit
themselves as became her sons. Then, as the battle
raged, now here, now there, he passed out of my
sight.</p>

<p>It is a soldier’s duty to do what his general bids
him; but I was glad when Sir Nicholas called upon
Burke and myself to lead our people against that part
of Fitzmaurice’s army which was chiefly made up of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the Geraldines, and which was commanded by Sir
James himself. Sir Nicholas rightly judged that our
animosity would burn more fiercely against them
than against the Spaniards, and we sprang upon them
with a fury they could not long withstand.</p>

<p>At the first onset they met us bravely, and for
awhile there was much fierce and terrible fighting.
Above their hosts there rose the Pope’s banner of
blue and gold, and around it and Sanders, who held
it, and his priests, they made a stubborn resistance.
But they were forced back, and ever back.</p>

<p>I strove to come at Fitzmaurice, but could not for
the press. We had a score to settle, and settled it
was, but not by me, for it was Burke who dealt him
the fatal blow. I had just parried the cunning thrust
of a sword, as I was trying to reach Fitzmaurice,
when I saw the flash of a pistol in Burke’s hand, and
then Sir James swayed and fell forward from his
horse. When the Geraldines knew what had taken
place, they turned and fled, bearing Sanders and his
banner along with them, into the thicknesses of the
forest.</p>

<p>Having witnessed the defeat and flight of their
Irish allies, the Spaniards could not but be aware that
they had small chance of retrieving the fortunes of the
day, and they now began to retreat. Attacked on the
flanks as well as in the front, they were thrown into
disorder, and their retreat became a rout, each man
striving to save himself. A few, however, stood
their ground to the last, and among them was de
Vilela.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take him alive!” I shouted; but the words came
too late.</p>

<p>I was almost beside him, for I had hoped that he
would surrender to me if I asked him to do so, and
with that purpose had fought my way even through
the English to get near him; but before I reached
him he had fallen, his armour all stained with blood,
and his sword broken in his hand.</p>

<p>With a great, wild cry of grief, the sharpness of
which was like the sundering of my spirit from my
body, I threw my sword upon the ground, and, kneeling
beside him, called to him to speak to me if he
were yet alive. His hand feebly pressed mine, while
I wept and sobbed like a little child. The lips
trembled and opened; the half-shut eyelids faintly
quivered; but he could not speak. Again, however,
my hand was feebly pressed. And so he passed&mdash;still
with his hand in mine&mdash;this noble gentleman
of Spain.</p>

<p>Nor does there go by a day when I do not think
of de Vilela, the man to whom I owed so much&mdash;so
much that I can never repay.</p>

<p>It was the custom in these wars of ours to cut off
the heads of the principal men among our fallen
enemies; this the body of Sir James Fitzmaurice
suffered, the head being sent to Dublin, where it
was tarred, and put on a spike above the Castle
gate.</p>

<p>But no such indignity befell the body of de Vilela,
for, having obtained permission from Sir Nicholas, I
took my men, made a solemn mourning for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
buried him on the field of battle, where the waters of
the Mulkern go murmuring past; and there he lies,
that true and noble gentleman, in a grave without
a name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And thus ended the battle of Barrington Bridge, as
it is called, entailing with it the overthrow and
collapse of the rising, for the death of Fitzmaurice&mdash;although
the war lingered on for long afterwards&mdash;was
the death of any chance of success it had.</p>

<p>Desmond, who had been hanging about in the
vicinity during the battle, but had taken no part in
it, later met with an inglorious end, and with him
perished his house.</p>

<p>As for Richard Burke and myself, we accompanied
Sir Nicholas Malby and his army in various
expeditions, until the beginning of the winter, when
he set out overland to Galway, and we sailed from
Limerick the same day in our ships for that city also.
Heaven sent us fair and gentle gales&mdash;perhaps, to
make up for all the storms through which we had
passed&mdash;and we came safely into the port of Galway
where we lay several days waiting for Sir Nicholas;
for, at his particular request, we&mdash;Grace O’Malley and
the MacWilliam, and Eva and I&mdash;were to be married
in the church of St. Nicholas of Myra.</p>

<p>And I had heard that when these events came to
pass, there were among the spectators many who
loved us and wished us well, and many who did not;
but to which of these classes Sir Nicholas really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
belonged I know not, for, in the years that came
after, he and Grace O’Malley and her husband,
Richard Burke, had many disputes, and the “Queen’s
peace” was often broken.</p>

<p>As for myself and Eva, we sailed away from
Ireland to my old home in Isla, where I was chosen
chief in the room of my uncle, who had succeeded
my father, and who was now dead. It was in <i>The
Cross of Blood</i>&mdash;Grace O’Malley’s last gift to me&mdash;that
we made our journey, and that I returned to
these isles of Scotland.</p>

<p>Many years have passed since, and in our life
there has been winter as well as summer; but still
there is the same light in Eva’s eyes, and the same
love in her voice. It has been our happy lot to grow
old together&mdash;to grow old in our love for each other,
though that love itself is as fresh and new as the
flowers of the first mornings of summer.</p>

<p>And so we await the inevitable end.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
